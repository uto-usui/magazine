Many UI trends are designed to capture attention and signal innovation, but those goals often conflict with the needs of mental health apps: reducing cognitive strain, fostering trust, and providing a sense of refuge. Kat Homan introduces an evaluation framework that helps designers assess whether trendy visual and interaction patterns support or undermine the unique goals of mental health experiences.

Mental health applications keep facing a continuing, measurable crisis: many people stop using them quickly. The data is stark: [almost 95% of users who open the app on day 1 abandon the app by day 30](https://www.jmir.org/2019/9/e14567/), with a median 30-day retention of only 3.3%. Even the recognised mental health giants lose around [50% of their users](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-018-1050-9) within the first ten days. This severe engagement loss and retention collapse are why effective interface design must be a clinical and operational priority. Good design is not merely aesthetic; it is a fundamental **tool for user retention**.

[![App 30-day retention by mental health focus](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/01-app-30day-retention-mental-health.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/01-app-30day-retention-mental-health.png)

([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/01-app-30day-retention-mental-health.png))

While many factors drive this abandonment, research suggests that [mental health apps have tended to prioritise visual appeal](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8844980/) at the expense of what actually **sustains** users. In a space defined by vulnerability and cognitive strain, chasing visual fashion risks adding effort when users have the least to spare — quietly trading away the **utility** and **trust** the app depends on. Users don’t open mental health apps out of curiosity, but from need — often while stressed, anxious, overwhelmed, or exhausted. In these states, an unconventional icon, a confusing gesture, or a flashy animation instead of a delightful surprise becomes [an extra cognitive overload](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6093283/#:~:text=Many%20individuals%20with%20serious%20mental,make%20decisions%20on%20their%20behalf.). Moreover, [it becomes a reason to disengage](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/14/6/308).

In those moments, visual experimentation from a mild distraction can turn into a friction that undermines the very help the app is meant to deliver. A solution must be a visual interface that is simple in usage and understanding from the first moment.

## The High Cost Of Trend-driven Design In Mental Health

Before we look into the specific problems, we must recognise a core tension: many UI trends are optimised for goals that mental health apps don’t share.

> Trend design is often about capturing attention and signaling innovation. Mental health design, in contrast, must be about **offering refuge**, **reducing strain**, and **building trust**.

[![Trend UI vs Mental health UI](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/02-trend-ui-mental-health-ui.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/02-trend-ui-mental-health-ui.png)

([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/02-trend-ui-mental-health-ui.png))

Pursuing the former directly overrides the latter. It’s not a surface-level error of colour or font; it’s a foundational **conflict of purpose**. This tension surfaces across five fronts, each a place where adopting a trend on novelty alone can cost more engagement than it seeks to create.

[![Fronts where trend-driven Ul can works against therapeutic usability](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/03-fonts-trend-driven-ui-therapeutic-usability.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/03-fonts-trend-driven-ui-therapeutic-usability.png)

([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/03-fonts-trend-driven-ui-therapeutic-usability.png))

The proposed principles are not based on a single A/B test or one isolated study. They are built from published research on mental health app engagement, cognitive load, accessibility, and emotional response in mHealth, set against competitive product audits and app-store evidence, and pressure-tested against my own quantitative and qualitative product work. That last source I treat as an illustration, understanding the limits of personal experience. In this context, validation is less about proving that one interface pattern universally works and more about asking whether a design reduces effort, preserves agency, avoids emotional mismatch, and remains usable when the user is already under strain.

[![Distressed user's characteristics](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/04-distressed-user.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/04-distressed-user.png)

“Distressed user” here refers not to a diagnosis, but to a reduced-capacity state in which everyday tasks, choices, and self-care can require more effort than usual. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/04-distressed-user.png))

**A note on the examples**: _This isn’t a ranking of apps. Every app has its own positioning, target audience, constraints, and business pressures that may not be visible from outside, and a pattern that strains a user in distress may be exactly right for that product’s actual goal. I’m reading individual, visible design decisions for one question only: how they might affect someone arriving in a low-capacity state._

## 1\. Cognitive Friction: When Design Becomes A Barrier To Healing

The primary goal of any mental health tool is to reduce, not increase, cognitive load. Yet, many trendy interfaces achieve the opposite. [Neo-brutalist layouts](https://www.onething.design/post/neo-brutalism-ui-design-trend) with stark contrasts demand visual parsing. [Hidden navigation menus](https://raw.studio/blog/why-menus-are-disappearing-in-modern-ux/) that rely on non-standard swipes turn simple tasks into puzzles. [Abstract, unlabeled icons](https://makeitfable.com/article/can-eaa-boost-ux-and-profit/) force users to guess rather than recognise. Each of these patterns adds friction — seconds of hesitation, a moment of confusion — and for a user whose mental energy is already low, those costs start to accumulate.

[![Abstract controls](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/05-abstract-controls.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/05-abstract-controls.png)

Abstract controls can add interpretation effort, even in otherwise polished wellbeing interfaces. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/05-abstract-controls.png))

This friction is most damaging during acute need. [Research suggests](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9474730/) that when a user is in a state of high anxiety or depression, even typing or making simple choices can feel overwhelming. When an interface demands high cognitive effort at the moment support is needed, it doesn’t just make that session harder — it gives an overwhelmed user a **reason to close the app**, and a reason not to reopen it. Each point of confusion can become a place where a user may quit for good.

[Other findings](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9474730/) show that apps with simple interfaces reduce the time and effort required to engage, directly improving retention. Conversely, a complex, trend-driven UI increases that time, creating an obstacle course that undermines the very healthy habit formation the app is meant to support.

This does not mean that every mental health product must be visually plain or minimal. The issue is whether the interface meets the **user’s current capacity**.

A panic-support tool, for example, works best when it offers a small number of obvious actions, rather than asking the user to browse. However, if a calming action meant for a moment of panic instead surfaces an upgrade screen, the product fails the user at precisely the point where failing matters most. Monetization is not the issue by itself; the issue is whether it appears at a point where the user expects immediate support.

[![A clear panic entry point](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/06-panic-entry.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/06-panic-entry.png)

A clear panic entry point lowers cognitive load; surprise paywalls inside support actions can reintroduce friction. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/06-panic-entry.png))

[Nonori](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dualphotonlabs.nonori&hl=en) shows the same principle in a more reflective context. The app does not present the user with a large content library or a complex dashboard at the start. Instead, it leads them through a simple, linear sequence of small actions. The value of this pattern is that it reduces the effort needed to begin. When a user is tired, anxious, or mentally overloaded, knowing exactly what to do next can lower the barrier to returning.

[![A linear flow](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/07-linear-flow.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/07-linear-flow.png)

A linear flow reduces the need to decide what to do next. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/07-linear-flow.png))

At the other end of the spectrum, comprehensive tracking apps show a different trade-off. [_Bearable_](https://bearable.app/), for example, is genuinely powerful: it consolidates almost everything a person tracks — mood, symptoms, sleep, medication, habits, reports, correlations — into one place. For users managing chronic conditions or preparing for medical appointments, this can be genuinely useful. But the same comprehensiveness can become a burden for an exhausted user. Dense dashboards and multi-step check-ins require executive capacity — the very resource that anxiety, depression, burnout, or brain fog often reduce.

[![Comprehensive tracking](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/08-comprehensive-tracking.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/08-comprehensive-tracking.png)

Comprehensive tracking can be valuable, but dense check-ins require executive capacity. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/08-comprehensive-tracking.png))

A similar tension appears in anxiety apps with strong support content but busy entry points. A product may contain useful features yet still make the first screen feel noisy with too many cards, locked items, playful characters, or upgrade prompts. This is not evidence that the product is bad. It shows how the same interface can feel very different depending on the user’s state: clear enough during exploration, but too demanding during distress.

[![Visually rich home screens](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/09-visually-rich-home-screens.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/09-visually-rich-home-screens.png)

In low-capacity states, visually rich home screens can make the path to support harder to find. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/09-visually-rich-home-screens.png))

This insight shaped a guiding principle for our work: **every interaction point must meet users at their current level of capacity**, removing mechanical and cognitive barriers rather than adding to them. This principle guided our integration of low-friction, state-aware interactions in apps like [_Bear Room_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=world.dobra.bearroom), a stress and anxiety reduction app, and [_Teeni_](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/teeni-supported-parenting/id6618150447), an emotional-wellbeing app for parents of teens.

In [_Bear Room_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=world.dobra.bearroom), we already had a fast mood-based flow built around four emotion cards. At the same time, our product research supported a second need: users also wanted more personalised support. We avoided making this a long selection flow or a typing-only route because both can still create friction for people under stress or anxiety. Instead, we made voice a primary, prominent path, always alongside a text alternative. A central microphone button allows users to share what’s on their mind. The app then uses AI to analyse the input and provide a tailored set of coping practices.

Rather than picking a single entry model, we kept two paths because they served different states. That matched what we saw in later analytics and user conversations: quick emotional selection worked better when users wanted speed, while open voice or text input worked better when they wanted personalisation and to feel more heard. This was more a pattern we noticed, without having the exact measured results.

[![Voice as a low-friction input](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/010-voice-low-friction-input.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/010-voice-low-friction-input.png)

Voice is used as a low-friction alternative to typing across different tasks in Bear Room. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/010-voice-low-friction-input.png))

Similarly, in [_Teeni_](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/teeni-supported-parenting/id6618150447), we directly addressed the cognitive friction of parenting stress by introducing **a “Quick Relief” button**. This creates an empathy-friendly flow for parents experiencing anger or frustration. The button initiates a dedicated “Hot Flow,” allowing them to first vent and relieve their immediate negative emotions through voice input. Only after this emotional release does the app gently guide them into the more reflective “Cold Flow” for the rest of the app’s resources. This sequential, state-sensitive design acknowledges that a user in peak distress cannot navigate a complex app; they need a direct, simple, and validating first step.

[![Teeni’s Quick Relief flow](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/011-teeni-quick-relief-flow.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/011-teeni-quick-relief-flow.png)

Teeni’s Quick Relief flow helps parents regulate before reflection. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/011-teeni-quick-relief-flow.png))

These solutions directly tackle cognitive friction by meeting users at their level of capacity, resisting trends that add visual or interaction complexity. Voice input and single-action buttons remove the mechanical and cognitive burden of navigation and typing. The result is an interface that feels reliably non-judgmental and genuinely helpful when users are least equipped to navigate complexity.

## 2\. Emotional Mismatch: The Trust Erosion Of Misaligned Design Tone

A user’s emotional state is the context in which a mental health app operates. This is why its visual language must be **empathetic** and **considerate**. [Research investigating how colour and aesthetics influence mood in mHealth apps](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14604582241295948) suggests a critical insight: users in distress show a strong preference for **subtlety**. They long for dark palettes, sleek and sophisticated looks, and clean, uncluttered aesthetics, explicitly noting that cheerful, bright colours, while seemingly appropriate, can create a jarring, even physically uncomfortable conflict with their current mood.

[![Subtle, grounded design for distress](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/012-emotional-alignment.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/012-emotional-alignment.png)

Emotional alignment is the fit between the product’s promise, visual tone, and the user’s likely emotional state. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/012-emotional-alignment.png))

This does not mean that every mental health or wellbeing app should look dark, quiet, or clinically restrained. The category is broad: it includes self-care, anxiety support, habit change, addiction recovery, trauma tools, therapy-adjacent products, and apps for more severe mental health contexts. A playful visual style may be appropriate for one product and a poor fit for another. What matters is not whether the interface is bright or muted, but whether its **emotional tone** fits the product’s purpose and the likely state in which users arrive.

Emotional mismatch can also appear in mechanics, not only in aesthetics. In [_Calmer_](https://gocalmer.com/), an anxiety and panic relief app, the interface itself appeared relatively clean and relaxed. Yet some of its engagement and monetisation mechanics sit in a different register from that relaxed: a discount wheel, or confetti celebrating a logged low mood. For a user who just recorded a hard moment, that shift — from quiet support to upsell or celebration — can land as a mismatch, whatever its intent.

[![Calmer's emotional mismatch](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/013-calmer-emotional-mismatch.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/013-calmer-emotional-mismatch.png)

([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/013-calmer-emotional-mismatch.png))

For [_Bear Room_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=world.dobra.bearroom), we prototyped a “cosy room” design informed by direct feedback from our users, which echoed the study’s conclusions. Several users in our research described the apps they had tried for similar needs as “too bright, too happy, and too overwhelming”. Users longed for a digital safe space. This was part of what pointed us toward a quieter palette in the final design: muted, earthy tones — neutral hues like soft greens and taupes — set against darker, calming backgrounds. For this product — a refuge for users arriving overwhelmed — that meant a middle ground: a space that feels safe without being gloomy. The interface avoided any bright alerts or sudden animations, making calmness the core feature.

[![Bear Room’s muted palette](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/014-bear-room-muted-palette.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/014-bear-room-muted-palette.png)

Bear Room’s muted palette was designed to create a grounded, safe, and emotionally low-friction atmosphere. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/014-bear-room-muted-palette.png))

This case underscores a critical principle: an overly cheerful, bold, or trend-forward interface can feel dismissive to someone in distress, creating a conflict that erodes trust. As [_Bear Room_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=world.dobra.bearroom) shows, trust is built when the interface respectfully aligns with the user’s emotional reality, **offering solace through subtlety** (which creates an overall feeling of a “welcoming and safe atmosphere”), not a solution through saturation.

## 3\. The Inconsistency Penalty: Why Novelty Undermines Routine

[Mental health often relies on routine and predictability](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-importance-of-keeping-a-routine-during-stressful-times-4802638#:~:text=Rachel%20Goldman%2C%20PhD,lack%20of%20concentration%2C%20and%20focus.&text=A%20lack%20of%20structure%20and,and%20routine%20throughout%20your%20day.). Yet many contemporary UI trends thrive on novelty and disruption, intentionally reimagining fundamental navigation. When an app introduces a novel interaction pattern, such as a unique swipe or a non-standard button behavior, it asks the user to learn something before they can act, forcing them into cognitive effort they can’t afford.

This does not mean that mental health apps must be plain, rigid, or generic. A product can have its own character, playfulness, and sense of identity. The question is whether that identity remains **understandable** and **predictable** when the user returns in a low-capacity state. A gamified self-care app like [_Finch_](https://finchcare.com/) may work well when the user arrives ready to explore, play, and build a routine. But open it after a hard day just to mark one task done, and the can’t-skip celebration screens that delight an engaged user become one more layer to get through before they reach what they came for.

[![Task-flow interruption through non-skippable gamification](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/015-cant-skip-celebration-screens.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/015-cant-skip-celebration-screens.png)

Playful identity can support routine, but repeated non-skippable moments may interrupt users who only want to complete a simple task. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/015-cant-skip-celebration-screens.png))

A similar tension appears in large meditation and wellbeing platforms. Apps such as [_Headspace_](https://www.headspace.com/) and [_Calm_](https://www.calm.com/) offer extensive libraries of different content. This breadth can be valuable during exploration. But in moments of stress, the product question becomes sharper: can the user return and immediately find the exact support they need, or do they have to search, filter, and relearn the structure?

[![Large content libraries](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/016-large-content-libraries.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/016-large-content-libraries.png)

Large content libraries can be valuable during exploration, but harder to navigate during distress. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/016-large-content-libraries.png))

Someone experiencing anxiety or executive dysfunction needs to use the tool in [a straightforward navigation manner](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333740636_Usability_Issues_in_Mental_Health_Applications), not an interface they have to learn each time anew.

[_PTSD Coach_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.vertical.ptsdcoach&hl=en), a public-health-oriented trauma-support app designed to help users learn about and manage symptoms after trauma, offers a useful positive example. Its interface is not trying to be fashion-forward. Its strength lies in a **stable information architecture**: users can learn, track symptoms, manage symptoms, and get support through clearly separated areas. For a user returning during distress, this **predictability** matters more than novelty.

[![Stable information architecture](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/017-stable-information-architecture.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/017-stable-information-architecture.png)

Stable IA supports return use: learn, track, manage symptoms, get support. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/017-stable-information-architecture.png))

[_CALMzone_](https://www.thecalmzone.net/calmzone-app) offers another useful example. Some of its breathing animations differ from standard visual patterns, but they remain tied to the exercise itself: the animation shows what to do, when to inhale, and when to hold. The guided audio screen also explicitly invites the user to put the phone down and listen. This is a rare and valuable form of interaction design: the product’s success is not more screen time, but reduced effort and regulation.

[![A good example of novel interaction design](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/018-novel-interaction-design.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/018-novel-interaction-design.png)

Novel interaction can work when it directly supports the exercise rather than distracting from it. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/018-novel-interaction-design.png))

These insights guided our approach in applications like [_Bear Room_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=world.dobra.bearroom), where **navigation reliability** was treated as a therapeutic feature. We intentionally crafted an experience of an empathetic guided flow.

Recognising that users would likely approach in states of overwhelm, we structured the interface as a clear, unwavering path, with a visible “Start” sign. Key emotional support tools here are represented as the room’s objects — symbols of daily life, unmistakably recognised by all. They are visually highlighted by design so that the user won’t get lost in the elements, can easily access the needed tool, and can remember their way around the digital space upon the next return to the app.

[![Navigation reliability as a guided flow](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/019-navigation-reliability-guided-flow.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/019-navigation-reliability-guided-flow.png)

Trend-driven interfaces sacrifice this navigational certainty for novelty. Each unconventional choice in mHealth apps, when core functions are buried behind experimental interactions or placed in unexpected locations, leads to a cumulative effect of **fatigue** instead of innovation. Users are not in a place to explore. They [abandon the entire practice of seeking digital support](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10924263/) when every interaction feels like solving a new puzzle. This does not restrict experimentation; it simply means that animations, micro-interactions, AI, or playful mechanics must serve the user’s state rather than interrupt it.

## 4\. The Silent Exclusion: How Trends Compromise Accessibility

Many popular UI trends can be exclusionary when applied without adaptation. The minimalist trend of low-contrast text fails users with visual impairments. Gesture-only navigation marginalises those with motor difficulties. Visually dense, animated interfaces can overwhelm users with cognitive or attentional conditions. In mental health, the population needing support [disproportionately includes individuals with these accessibility needs](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2021.742196/full).

[![Accessibility risks: low contrast, small text, dense layouts](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/020-accessibility-risks.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/020-accessibility-risks.png)

Low contrast, small text, and dense layouts can make support harder to access for users with visual, cognitive, or attentional needs. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/020-accessibility-risks.png))

Choosing a trending aesthetic over an accessible one is therefore an active decision to limit the app’s reach and efficacy. It ensures that those who might benefit most cannot use the tool effectively. Accessibility isn’t a layer you add at the end; it’s a **constraint you design within**, with most of it codified in [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). Body text needs 4.5:1 contrast against its background, large text and interface elements 3:1 — exactly what low-contrast minimalism fails. Interactive targets need a floor of 24×24 px (more for unsteady hands). Every gesture needs a visible button fallback, or you risk excluding anyone who can’t perform the swipe.

## 5\. The Coercion Paradox: When “Engagement” Becomes “Pressure”

A final, and often overlooked, consequence of trend-following is the adoption of engagement mechanics designed for entertainment, educational, or productivity apps. Features like streaks, aggressive notifications, and gamified reward systems are engineered to maximise screen time and create dependency. Although they have long been considered effective tools for increasing retention, in a mental health context, this approach can easily be misguided. What presents as “motivation” can quickly transform into [a source of performance pressure and guilt](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/19367244231196768). For a user managing depression, a broken streak or a missed daily goal can exacerbate the very feelings the app aims to alleviate.

[![Streaks examples](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/021-streaks.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/021-streaks.png)

Streaks can motivate some users, but missed days should not be framed as failure in non-linear recovery contexts. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/021-streaks.png))

These mechanics are not inherently unethical. In routine-building products, they can help some users. The risk appears when they are transferred into mental health contexts without adapting for shame, low energy, relapse, and non-linear recovery. A streak, for example, is not just a retention mechanic when the user is emotionally vulnerable. It can become a visible record of whether they have “kept up” with their well-being.

In the apps I reviewed, this tension appeared through familiar persuasion patterns: streaks, streak freezes, commitment copy, urgency-based notifications, _“don’t miss this offer”_ prompts, and success-framed buttons such as _“Yes, I want to succeed.”_ In self-care or wellbeing products, these details can make the app feel less like a supportive tool and more like another system the user has to satisfy.

[![Persuasion patterns](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/022-persuasion-patterns.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/022-persuasion-patterns.png)

([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/023-commitment-contracts.png))

Designers still need return triggers. A mental health app has little value if users install it once and forget it exists. But return mechanics must be adapted to the emotional context. In [_Bear Room_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=world.dobra.bearroom), for example, this philosophy is embodied in short, forgiving three-day streaks: the streak does not reset when a user misses a day, and every third day brings a small benefit. **The goal is not to punish absence, but to gently support return.**

The same principle applies to lighter interactions. Bear Room includes a simple, optional bubble-popping game. Its purpose, however, is not to hook the user but to offer a brief, calming interlude. It is deliberately finite, providing a small mood lift and gently signposting other resources within the app. The value is in the momentary relief, not the extended session.

This commitment to supportive, non-coercive design extends to foundational app architecture:

-   **Respectful and User-Tailored Interaction Models**  
    The Pillow, a visual interface in the app, acts as a neutral, accepting space. Users can select a feeling or record a voice note, and the app responds with an AI-curated set of practices (28). It offers support without judgment, commentary, or pressure to “achieve” a certain state. Our app prioritises mood-aware algorithms to dynamically order activities. Breathing exercises or grounding techniques are surfaced based on the user’s reported emotional state, creating personal resonance without the need for an overwhelming content library.
-   **Feedback as a Reciprocal Exchange**  
    We approach feedback not as a data grab via constant emails but as a respectful dialogue. An unobtrusive object allows users to contribute at a natural pause point, and their input is acknowledged with a small reward. This frames their participation as a valued gift, not a demanded obligation.

The mHealth apps design invites finding a challenging balance between boosting their use without being too demanding.

## The Scale Of The Stakes

This is not a niche concern affecting a fringe audience. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about one [billion people](https://www.who.int/news/item/02-09-2025-over-a-billion-people-living-with-mental-health-conditions-services-require-urgent-scale-up) globally live with a mental disorder, with depression alone affecting nearly 5% of adults. Critically, the overall number is rising — in the last decade, depression and anxiety cases have increased [by 25%](https://www.who.int/news/item/17-06-2022-who-highlights-urgent-need-to-transform-mental-health-and-mental-health-care). This vast and vulnerable population cannot afford for its tools to fail due to poor design. While UI trends aren’t inherently problematic, their application within wellbeing products demands a **radically contextual approach**.

Even a five-minute decompression tool between meetings has an emotional context, and a style chosen for its look — glassmorphism, a certain flavour of ultra-minimalism — can miss it, however sophisticated the audience. The point isn’t that these styles are wrong; it’s that **the look has to answer to the moment**. Soft biomorphic shapes or fluid transitions can genuinely help when they directly serve the goal of calm — and the same elements become noise when they’re there to impress.

> What carries the highest risk is lifting a visually striking “Dribbble shot” and applying it without deep adaptation: it solves for the designer’s portfolio, not the user’s need.

## A Practical Framework For Evaluation

The five fronts outlined above are not just a diagnostic lens; they are the foundation of an **evaluation framework** for anyone designing in the mental health space. Before incorporating any trendy visual or interaction pattern, it is worth running it through each of them in sequence:

[![A five-point check before adopting a Ul trend in mental health](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/024-practical-framework-evaluation.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/024-practical-framework-evaluation.png)

([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/designing-distressed-users-mental-health-apps-ui/024-practical-framework-evaluation.png))

-   **Cognitive load**  
    Does this reduce the effort required for someone who is overwhelmed, or does it add another layer of complexity to an already strained experience?
-   **Emotional alignment**  
    Does this support a wide spectrum of emotional states, including distress and exhaustion, or does it clash with the context in which users are most likely to arrive?
-   **Navigational reliability**  
    Does this build trust through predictability, allowing users to return and find their way without relearning, or does it prioritise novelty at the cost of consistency?
-   **Accessibility**  
    Does this uphold or enhance accessibility for diverse sensory and cognitive abilities, or does it quietly exclude the users who may need support the most?
-   **Engagement integrity**  
    Does this invite use in a way that is supportive and non-coercive, or does it borrow mechanics from entertainment products that may create pressure rather than relief?

A design that passes all five holds together as something more than usable: it becomes a tool that users can trust enough to return to in moments of genuine need.

Trends can be inspiring. They can win awards and generate buzz. But in mental health, sometimes the best design is the one that helps users feel understood — a **quiet helper** they trust enough to return to in moments of stress and vulnerability. It doesn’t steal the spotlight, but focuses on the user’s emotions. In the end, the ultimate goal is not for the interface to be seen — but for the support to be felt.
