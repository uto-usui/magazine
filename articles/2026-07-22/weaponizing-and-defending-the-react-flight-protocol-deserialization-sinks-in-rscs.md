While React Server Components rely on the custom Flight protocol to stream interactive UIs, this same mechanism introduces powerful deserialization sinks that attackers can exploit. Durgesh Pawar breaks down the mechanics behind the CVSS 10.0 “React2Shell” vulnerability to show how protocol manipulation can lead to remote code execution. It also covers a practical, ranked set of defenses, from strict schema validation to CSRF hardening, for securing React applications against these structural risks.

React Server Components don’t send HTML to your browser. They don’t send JSON either. When a server component renders, what actually travels over the wire is a custom streaming protocol called **Flight**. It’s a line-delimited format with its own type system, its own reference resolution, and its own rules for reconstructing executable behavior on the client.

Most React developers have never opened the Network tab and actually looked at a Flight payload. It looks like a mix of JSON fragments, dollar-sign-prefixed references, and module pointers that the React runtime silently reassembles into a live component tree. The framework handles it, so nobody questions it.

I’m not sure most teams have thought carefully about what that trust actually implies.

I started pulling apart the Flight protocol after [CVE-2025-55182](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/03/critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components) dropped in December 2025. The security community called it **React2Shell**, and for good reason. It was a CVSS 10.0, unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability sitting in the Flight deserialization layer. One crafted HTTP request to a Server Function endpoint, and an attacker had shell access. No credentials needed.

The federal Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency (CISA) added it to the [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog). [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/blog/etherrat-dprk-uses-novel-ethereum-implant-in-react2shell-attacks/) tied in-the-wild exploitation to North Korean state-sponsored actors deploying file-less implants through the Ethereum blockchain. That’s the kind of CVE that gets your attention.

After spending time in the source (mostly `getOutlinedModel` and `getChunk`, which is where the resolution logic that matters actually lives), I realized React2Shell wasn’t a one-off parsing bug. It was a symptom. Flight reconstructs executable references, lazy-loaded components, server RPC endpoints, and async state from a stream of text. That’s a **deserialization system**.

The attack surface extends well beyond a single missing [`hasOwnProperty`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty) check. This article covers how Flight works on the wire, where the deserialization sinks are, what attackers have already weaponized, and what’s still exposed.

This leads to a **ranked, practical set of defenses** for your own Server Components: schema validation on every Server Action, the [`server-only` package](https://react.dev/reference/react/experimental_taintUniqueValue#using-server-only-and-taintuniquevalue-to-prevent-leaking-secrets), cross-site request forgery (CSRF) hardening beyond framework defaults, and an assessment of what the Taint API and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) provide.

## Flight On The Wire

Open your browser’s Network tab on any Next.js App Router page and look for requests returning `Content-Type: text/x-component`. That’s Flight. It’s not a single JSON blob. It’s a streaming, line-delimited format where each line is a self-contained “row” that the client-side React runtime processes as it arrives over the connection.

Here’s what a simple Flight payload looks like in practice:

```
1:I["./src/components/ClientComponent.js",["chunks/main.js"],"default"]
2:J["$","article",null,{"children":"$1"}]
0:D{"name":"RootLayout","env":"Server"}
```

Row 1 is an import directive. It tells the client to load `ClientComponent.js` from the bundler’s chunk map. Row 2 is a JSON tree that constructs an `<article>` HTML element, and the `"$1"` inside `children` is a reference back to chunk 1 (the imported component). Row 0 defines the server execution context, marking this as a `RootLayout` running in the `Server` environment. Even in this tiny example, you can see the mix of structural data, module references, and cross-chunk pointers that makes Flight different from plain JSON.

### The Row Format

Every row follows the same syntax: `<ROW_ID>:<ROW_TAG><PAYLOAD>\n`. The row ID is a numeric identifier that other rows can reference. The tag is a single character (or short string) that tells the parser what kind of data follows. The payload is the actual content.

Here are the row tags I found while reading through the source:

Tag

Name

What it does

J

JSON Tree

Serialized virtual DOM nodes, component props, and HTML elements.

M

Module

Metadata for a specific Client Component module or chunk.

I

Import

Tells the client to load a module from the bundler’s chunk map.

HL

Hint/Preload

Instructs the browser to preload resources such as stylesheets or fonts.

D

Data

Server-rendered element context and environment info.

E

Error

Serialized server-side exceptions and error boundaries.

So far, this might look like a benign structured data format with some custom tags, but the real complexity and attack surface live in the **prefix system**.

### The `$` Prefix System

This is where I started paying closer attention.

When the client-side parser encounters a string value starting with `$`, it doesn’t treat it as literal text. It intercepts the string, checks the prefix, and routes it through a type-specific resolution path. The `parseModelString` function in `ReactFlightClient.js` is where this happens. It’s essentially a big switch statement on the character after `$`.

Prefix

Type

What the parser does with it

`$`

Model Reference

Resolves to another chunk in the stream (e.g., `$2` points to row 2).

`$:`

Property Access

Traverses into a resolved chunk’s properties (e.g., `$1:user:name`).

`$S`

Symbol

Creates a native JavaScript `Symbol`.

`$F`

Server Reference

Represents a callable Server Action (an RPC endpoint on the server).

`$L`

Lazy Component

Defers component loading until it’s needed in the render tree

`$@`

Promise/Raw Chunk

Returns the internal Chunk wrapper object itself (often acting as a Thenable/Promise), not its resolved value.

`$B`

Blob/Binary

Triggers the blob deserialization handler for binary data.

Every other prefix resolves a chunk and gives you the parsed result. `$@` hands you the raw internal `Chunk` object instead, the wrapper React uses to track resolution state, pending callbacks, and internal metadata (which is why it’s used for Promises and why exploits use it to get a mutable handle). Exposing framework plumbing through the protocol looks like a design mistake to me, though I’d be interested to hear the rationale if there is one.

And `$:` (property access) is the other critical prefix. It lets the protocol specify a path like `$1:user:name`, which tells the parser to resolve chunk 1, then access `.user`, then access `.name` on the result. That’s arbitrary property traversal driven by data in the stream. If you’ve spent any time auditing JavaScript for prototype pollution, that pattern should feel familiar.

### This Is Not Just A Data Format

Flight is not JSON with extra steps. JSON gives you data. Flight gives you **behavior**. It reconstructs module references that trigger client-side code loading, creates server action endpoints the client can invoke as RPC calls, sets up Promise chains that the React runtime will `await`, and builds lazy-loaded component boundaries that execute on demand.

Whether React developers think of it that way or not, the mechanics look very similar to deserialization systems that have historically caused problems. The stream doesn’t just describe what the UI looks like. It instructs the client runtime on what code to load, what functions to call, and what to trust.

If you want to read the implementation yourself, fair warning: the chunk resolution path is miserable to follow. State transitions bounce between helper functions, and the naming obscures what the code is actually doing. I gave up on static reading and just set breakpoints. The key files are [`react-client/src/ReactFlightClient.js`](https://github.com/react/react/blob/main/packages/react-client/src/ReactFlightClient.js) for the client-side parser (look for `parseModelString`, `getChunk`, `reviveModel`, and `getOutlinedModel`) and [`react-server/src/ReactFlightServer.js`](https://github.com/react/react/blob/main/packages/react-server/src/ReactFlightServer.js) for the serialization side. The reply handler for Server Actions lives in [`react-server/src/ReactFlightReplyServer.js`](https://github.com/react/react/blob/main/packages/react-server/src/ReactFlightReplyServer.js).

## Why Flight Is A Deserialization Sink

The deserialization pattern is familiar: Java’s `ObjectInputStream` gave us ysoserial, Python’s `pickle` executes code on `load()`, PHP’s `unserialize` chains `__wakeup` and `__destruct` methods, and .NET’s `BinaryFormatter` was deprecated entirely.

> The pattern: deserialize attacker-controlled input → invoke behavior during reconstruction → lose control of execution.

So JavaScript should be immune to this, right? `JSON.parse()` only produces plain data objects. No constructors fire. No magic methods run. You get back exactly what the JSON string describes, nothing more.

That’s true for raw `JSON.parse()`. But it stops being true the moment a framework wraps custom deserialization logic around it. And that’s exactly what Flight does.

### Prototype Pollution

JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance. Every object has a `__proto__` link to its prototype, and property lookups walk up this chain. If an attacker injects `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` as a key during reconstruction, they modify the shared base prototypes that all objects inherit from. Downstream code reads attacker-controlled values without knowing.

Flight’s `$:` prefix performs property traversal on deserialized objects. The `getOutlinedModel` function walks colon-separated paths like `$1:user:name` by iterating through each segment and accessing it on the parent object. If those path segments include `__proto__` or `constructor`, the traversal walks straight up the prototype chain. That’s not a theoretical risk. It’s exactly how React2Shell worked.

### Duck Typing and Thenables

The V8 engine (and the JavaScript spec) treats any object with a `.then` property as a **Thenable**. When you `await` something, the runtime checks for `.then` and calls it if it exists. No class check. No internal slot verification. If `.then` is callable, it gets invoked.

Flight resolves chunks asynchronously. If an attacker constructs an object with a manipulated `.then` property and gets it into the chunk resolution pipeline, the runtime calls the attacker’s function during normal await behavior. The language semantics do the work.

I initially focused on `$F` because forging Server Action references seemed like the obvious attack surface. After tracing the resolution path, `$:` property traversal looked much more interesting. I also spent a few hours examining chunk status transitions (pending, blocked, resolved, errored) to see if you could force a chunk into an unexpected state, though that approach didn’t yield any results.

### The Core Problem

These two risks converge in Flight because the protocol doesn’t just deserialize data. It deserializes _behavior_. The `$` prefix system dictates which execution path the parser takes: `$F` creates a callable server endpoint, `$L` sets up lazy code loading, `$B` triggers a blob handler, `$@` exposes internal framework state. The parser’s control flow is driven entirely by what’s in the stream.

If an attacker can influence the stream’s content, they control which functions the parser calls, which objects it constructs, and which internal state it exposes.

## The Mechanics Of React2Shell

This is the CVE that proved the theory. [CVE-2025-55182](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55182), nicknamed React2Shell, is a CVSS 10.0 unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the Flight deserialization layer. One HTTP request, no login required, full shell access.

I want to walk through the entire gadget chain because understanding it reveals how much power the Flight protocol hands to an attacker who can control the stream.

### The Root Cause

The vulnerability sits in `getOutlinedModel`, a function responsible for resolving deep property paths from the `$:` reference system. The instance used in the exploit chain lives in the server-side reply handling code (`ReactFlightReplyServer.js`). When the parser encounters a reference like `$1:user:name`, it splits on the colons and walks the path segment by segment. Here’s the vulnerable loop:

```
for (key = 1; key < reference.length; key++)
    parentObject = parentObject[reference[key]];
```

Two lines. No `hasOwnProperty` check. No validation that the property exists on the object itself rather than somewhere up the prototype chain. Just `parentObject[reference[key]]` and move on.

So an attacker supplies `$1:__proto__:constructor:constructor`, and the loop traverses from a plain JSON object up through `Object.prototype` to the `Object` constructor to the `Function` constructor. `Function` in JavaScript behaves like `eval()`. `Function("arbitrary code")()` executes.

No allowlist on property names. No check for `__proto__`. I searched `reviveModel` and the chunk initialization path for any filtering. Nothing.

### The Gadget Chain

Getting from _“I can reach the Function constructor”_ to _“I have RCE”_ requires chaining several Flight protocol features together. The [Resecurity write-up](https://resecurity.com/blog/article/react2shell-explained-cve-2025-55182-from-vulnerability-discovery-to-exploitation) covers the full chain in detail; here’s the high-level sequence:

-   **Step 1: Prototype walk to Function.**  
    The `$:` path `__proto__:constructor:constructor` walks from any plain object to `Object.prototype`, then to the `Object` constructor, then to `Function` — JavaScript’s built-in `eval()` equivalent.
-   **Step 2: Raw chunk self-reference.**  
    `$@0` returns the raw internal `Chunk` wrapper instead of its resolved value, giving the attacker a mutable handle on React’s internal state machine.
-   **Step 3: Thenable hijack.**  
    The attacker sets the chunk’s `.then` to `Chunk.prototype.then`, so React’s resolution pipeline treats the manipulated chunk as a legitimate Promise-like object and awaits it.
-   **Step 4: Context confusion.**  
    During the second deserialization pass, the payload overwrites `_response._formData.get` to point to the hijacked `Function` constructor and places the attacker’s shell command into `_response._prefix`.
-   **Step 5: Trigger via blob handler.**  
    `$B0` invokes the blob handler, which internally calls `response._formData.get(response._prefix + blobId)` — now equivalent to `Function("attacker_shell_command")()`. That’s arbitrary code execution with whatever privileges the Node.js process has.

Each step uses a legitimate Flight protocol feature in a way the designers didn’t anticipate. There’s no single “broken” feature. The vulnerability emerges from how these features compose when an attacker controls the input.

### Impact

The numbers on this one are stark:

-   CVSS 10.0. The maximum possible score.
-   Unauthenticated and pre-auth. No credentials needed — and the deserialization happens before any application-level auth checks run, so even endpoints behind login walls are exposed.
-   Single HTTP request. One POST to a Server Function endpoint.
-   Affected React 19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0, across `react-server-dom-webpack`, `react-server-dom-parcel`, and `react-server-dom-turbopack`.
-   CISA added it to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog within days.

### What Happened In The Wild

Exploitation was immediate. [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/blog/etherrat-dprk-uses-novel-ethereum-implant-in-react2shell-attacks/) published research linking **EtherRAT** deployments to North Korean state-sponsored actors who weaponized the vulnerability within hours of disclosure. [EtherRAT](https://www.sysdig.com/blog/etherrat-dprk-uses-novel-ethereum-implant-in-react2shell-attacks) is a file-less implant that uses the Ethereum blockchain for command-and-control communication — a technique researchers call “EtherHiding” — making takedown nearly impossible because you can’t seize a blockchain.

Separately, Palo Alto’s [Unit 42 documented](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cve-2025-55182-react-and-cve-2025-66478-next/) a backdoor called **KSwapDoor** that masquerades as `[kswapd1]` on infected Linux systems, blending into process lists alongside the legitimate `kswapd0` kernel swap daemon; their analysis confirms KSwapDoor uses RC4 encryption to protect its internal strings and configuration data, while C2 communications run over AES-256-CFB with [Diffie-Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9CHellman_key_exchange) across a P2P mesh network. The speed and sophistication of these campaigns — state-sponsored actors deploying novel implants through a single unauthenticated HTTP request — underscores why a CVSS 10.0 in a deserialization layer demands immediate patching, not triage.

## The Fix

The React team’s patch is clean and targeted. The core change caches the genuine `hasOwnProperty` method at module load time:

```
var hasOwnProperty = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;
```

Then every property check in the deserialization path uses `.call()` to invoke the cached reference:

```
hasOwnProperty.call(value, i);
```

Even if an attacker shadows `hasOwnProperty` on a malicious object, the check uses the original prototype method. The prototype chain traversal that powered the gadget chain is blocked. This fix shipped in React 19.0.1, 19.1.2, and 19.2.1.

The fix is correct. But reading through the patches, I noticed the React team hardened ownership checks while leaving the property traversal model intact. The `$:` prefix still walks colon-separated paths; it just validates each step now. I think exposing arbitrary property traversal through a network protocol was a design mistake, and the patch treats the symptom. If future bugs emerge, they’ll likely come from this same area.

The framework patch closes the known gadget chain, but it doesn’t change the fundamental dynamic: the Flight protocol still reconstructs behavior — executable references, module imports, RPC endpoints, async state — from a stream of text. That reconstruction happens before your application code runs, before your validation logic fires, before your auth middleware even sees the request. Relying solely on the framework to protect your Server Components means trusting that every edge case in a complex deserialization parser has been found and fixed. The defenses that follow are the practical steps you can take to limit the blast radius on your own.

## Defenses, Ranked By Impact

Some of these close real attack paths. Others mostly make you feel safer than you are. I’ve ranked these from most-to-least impactful based on what I’ve seen in the vulnerability research. If you only have time for one change, start at the top.

### 1\. Input Validation On Server Actions (Zod, Valibot)

This is the single most impactful thing you can do at the application level. The Flight deserializer processes raw, unvalidated network input before your code takes control. Strict schema validation is your primary defense against whatever the protocol reconstructs.

Put a schema validation call at the very top of every Server Action, before any business logic runs — and I mean before _anything_, including logging. If you log an argument before validating it, and that argument triggers the stringification bug from CVE-2025-55183, you’ve leaked source code before your validation even had a chance to run.

[Zod](https://zod.dev/) and [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/) both work well for this. Validate types, shapes, string lengths, numeric bounds, and enumerated values. Reject anything that doesn’t match. Use `.safeParse()`, not `.parse()` — the throwing variant can surface internal error details in the response if you’re not careful with your error boundaries.

```
"use server"
import { z } from "zod"

const UpdateProfileSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1).max(100),
  email: z.string().email(),
  role: z.enum(["user", "editor"]),
})

export async function updateProfile(formData: FormData) {
  const parsed = UpdateProfileSchema.safeParse({
    name: formData.get("name"),
    email: formData.get("email"),
    role: formData.get("role"),
  })
  if (!parsed.success) return { error: "Invalid input" }
  // proceed with parsed.data, this is now the only shape
  // your business logic ever sees
}
```

**One important nuance**: If your Server Action accepts a plain object argument (not `FormData`), validate the whole argument — don’t destructure first and validate fields individually. Destructuring before validation means you’re already accessing properties on the unvalidated input, which is exactly the kind of operation the Flight deserializer can exploit.

```
"use server"
import { z } from "zod"

const CommentSchema = z.object({
  postId: z.string().uuid(),
  body: z.string().min(1).max(5000),
})

// Good: validate the raw argument first
export async function addComment(data: unknown) {
  const parsed = CommentSchema.safeParse(data)
  if (!parsed.success) return { error: "Invalid input" }
  await db.comments.create(parsed.data)
}

// Bad: destructuring before validation
export async function addCommentUnsafe(
  { postId, body }: { postId: string; body: string }
) {
  // by the time this runs, you've already accessed properties
  // on the deserialized input
  const parsed = CommentSchema.safeParse({ postId, body })
  // ...
}
```

If your Server Action doesn’t start with a schema parse, it’s a vulnerability waiting to happen. I’d argue this should be a lint rule — and if you’re running `eslint-plugin-react`, consider writing a custom rule that flags any `"use server"` export without a validation call in its first statement.

### 2\. The `server-only` Package

The `server-only` package is straightforward and effective.

Import `server-only` at the top of any file that contains database credentials, raw API calls, internal business logic, or anything else that should never cross the server-client boundary. If a Client Component tries to import that file (directly or transitively), the build fails with a clear error.

```
import "server-only"
import { db } from "./database"

export async function getUser(id: string) {
  return db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1", [id])
}
```

The failure mode to watch for is [barrel files](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-are-barrel-files). If you re-export a server-only function through an `index.ts` that also exports client-safe utilities, any Client Component importing from that barrel will pull in the `server-only` module transitively and break the build — or worse, if the barrel doesn’t include the `server-only` import itself, it may silently let server code through. Keep server-only modules in separate files with their own import paths.

```
// Don't do this: barrel re-export mixes boundaries
// src/utils/index.ts
export { getUser } from "./users"     // has "server-only"
export { formatDate } from "./dates"  // client-safe

// Do this: separate import paths
// Client Component imports from "src/utils/dates" directly
// Server Component imports from "src/utils/users" directly
```

It also won’t protect you from data leaking through _return values_. If a Server Component calls `getUser()` and passes the full user object (including `passwordHash` or `internalRole`) as props to a Client Component, that data rides the Flight stream to the browser. The `server-only` guard prevents the _code_ from crossing the boundary, not the _data_ the code returns. You must explicitly filter your return shapes.

### 3\. CSRF Protections

After CVE-2026-27978, relying solely on Next.js’s built-in `Origin` vs. `Host` header check isn’t enough. The `Origin: null` bypass showed that framework-level CSRF protection has edge cases.

For state-changing Server Actions (anything that writes data, deletes records, or modifies permissions), layer your own protections on top of the framework’s defaults.

**Cookie configuration.**  
Set `SameSite=Strict` or `SameSite=Lax` on session cookies. If you’re using `next-auth` or a custom session library, verify this is set explicitly — don’t rely on browser defaults, which vary.

```
// next.config.js or your auth configuration
cookies: {
  sessionToken: {
    name: "__session",
    options: {
      httpOnly: true,
      sameSite: "strict",
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
      path: "/",
    },
  },
}
```

**Explicit CSRF tokens.**  
For high-value operations (password changes, role assignments, payment actions), generate a per-session CSRF token on the server, embed it in a hidden form field or custom header, and validate it in the Server Action before proceeding.

```
"use server"
import { cookies } from "next/headers"
import { validateCsrfToken } from "@/lib/csrf"

export async function deleteAccount(formData: FormData) {
  const token = formData.get("csrf_token") as string
  const sessionToken = (await cookies()).get("csrf_secret")?.value
  if (!validateCsrfToken(token, sessionToken)) {
    return { error: "Invalid request" }
  }
  // proceed with deletion
}
```

**The `allowedOrigins` gotcha.**  
Never, under any circumstances, add `'null'` to `experimental.serverActions.allowedOrigins` in your Next.js config (even if the [officially advisory](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-27978) is more nuanced, saying _“unless intentionally required and additionally protected”_). That string literal matches `Origin: null` — the exact header that sandboxed iframes send — and it reopens the CVE-2026-27978 bypass. If you’re seeing CSRF failures from legitimate requests, the fix is to configure your reverse proxy to set the correct `Origin` and `Host` headers, not to weaken the validation.

```
// Never do this
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    serverActions: {
      allowedOrigins: ["null"],  // reopens CSRF bypass
    },
  },
}
```

### 4\. The `hasOwnProperty` Patch

I covered this in detail in the [React2Shell section](#the-mechanics-of-react2shell). The fix is correct, and it completely neutralizes the known gadget chain. It shipped fast, which I respect.

The action item here is to verify you’re actually running a patched version. The RCE fix landed in React 19.0.1, 19.1.2, and 19.2.1. Check your lockfile:

```
# npm
npm ls react react-dom react-server-dom-webpack

# pnpm
pnpm ls react react-dom react-server-dom-webpack

# yarn
yarn why react-server-dom-webpack
```

If you see 19.0.0, 19.1.0â€“19.1.1, or 19.2.0, you’re vulnerable to the RCE. Update immediately. And don’t stop there: the DoS fixes (CVE-2025-55184, CVE-2025-67779, CVE-2026-23864) require 19.0.4+, 19.1.5+, or 19.2.4+. If you updated after React2Shell and then stopped paying attention, you may still be running a version vulnerable to the DoS variants.

It’s a reactive patch, not a structural redesign.

**Note**: _More on that in [Where This Goes Next](#where-this-goes-next)._

### 5\. The Taint API

React’s `taintObjectReference` and `taintUniqueValue` functions register objects or strings with the runtime. If tainted data tries to pass through the Flight serializer, it throws an error. The idea is to prevent sensitive data — user records, API keys, tokens — from accidentally leaking into the client.

Here’s how it looks in practice:

```
import {
  experimental_taintObjectReference as taintObjectReference
} from "react"
import "server-only"

export async function getUserRecord(id: string) {
  const user = await db.users.findUnique({ where: { id } })
  taintObjectReference(
    "Do not pass the full user object to Client Components. " +
    "Select only the fields you need.",
    user
  )
  return user
}
```

If a Server Component passes the tainted `user` object as props to a Client Component, React throws it at serialization time with your custom error message. That’s genuinely useful as a development-time guardrail.

The catch — and it’s a significant one — is that taint tracks _object references_, not data content. Any derivation breaks the tracking:

```
const user = await getUserRecord(id)

// taint is lost. Spread creates a new object.
<ClientProfile user={{ ...user }} />

// taint is lost. Individual properties aren't tracked.
<ClientProfile token={user.apiToken} />

// taint is lost. Serialization round-trip creates new refs.
<ClientProfile user={JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(user))} />

// taint fires. Same object reference.
<ClientProfile user={user} />
```

`taintUniqueValue` works on specific strings (like API keys), but it’s also reference-based. If the same key value appears in a different variable, the taint doesn’t follow.

Think of taint as a development guardrail, not a security boundary. It catches honest mistakes: a developer accidentally passing a full user object to the client. It won’t stop an attacker who can influence what gets serialized, and it won’t survive routine data transformations that your own code performs. It’s a useful defense-in-depth layer, but shouldn’t be your primary boundary.

### 6\. WAFs

Web Application Firewalls can add a detection layer for known attack patterns. They can inspect POST requests carrying the `Next-Action` header, block payloads containing `constructor:constructor` or `__proto__` chains, and flag error responses containing `E{"digest"` patterns that indicate the server is leaking internal error details.

If you’re running a WAF, here are specific patterns worth adding:

```
# Block prototype pollution attempts in request bodies
Rule: body contains "__proto__" OR "constructor:constructor"
Action: BLOCK
Scope: POST requests with header "Next-Action"

# Flag potential Flight error leakage in responses
Rule: response body matches /E\{"digest":"[^"]+"/
Action: LOG + ALERT
Scope: responses with Content-Type "text/x-component"

# Block excessively large Server Action payloads
Rule: Content-Length > 1MB for POST with "Next-Action" header
Action: BLOCK (mitigates CVE-2026-23864 zipbomb vector)
```

But attackers know about WAF inspection buffers, and they’re usually around 128KB. Prepend 130KB of padding before the malicious payload, and the WAF inspects the padding, finds nothing, and lets the request through. Chunked Transfer-Encoding tricks accomplish the same thing.

The failure mode is treating WAF coverage as a security boundary rather than a noise-reduction layer. WAFs catch automated scanners and low-effort attacks, and that has real value. But a motivated attacker will bypass them with padding or encoding tricks. The defenses that actually stop sophisticated attacks are the ones earlier in this list: validating input before it reaches your business logic, keeping sensitive code off the wire, and staying on patched versions.

## What Came After React2Shell

React2Shell wasn’t the end of it. The security audits that followed the December 2025 disclosure shook out a series of related vulnerabilities in the same deserialization surface. None of them are as severe as the original RCE, but they’re worth tracking because some of them required multiple rounds of patching.

5.3

CSRF Bypass

Next.js treated `Origin: null` (sandboxed iframes) as “missing” instead of “cross-origin.”

Next.js 16.1.7

The DoS pair ([CVE-2025-55184](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/11/denial-of-service-and-source-code-exposure-in-react-server-components) and CVE-2025-67779) is a textbook example of why deserialization parsers are hard to patch correctly. The first fix shipped, researchers found edge cases it missed, and a second round was needed. CVE-2026-23864 added a third DoS vector through unbounded memory allocation rather than CPU exhaustion. (See the [defenses section](#defenses-ranked-by-impact) above for specific version checks.)

CVE-2025-55183 is the sneaky one. It’s a source code exposure bug that triggers when a Server Function calls `JSON.stringify` (or any implicit stringification) on one of its arguments. Developers do this constantly for logging, debugging, or error reporting.

The attacker sends a crafted argument that, when stringified, causes the deserialization parser to reflect the function’s own source code back in the response. Business logic, database queries, and any hardcoded secrets sitting in Server Action files become readable by anyone who can send an HTTP request.

[CVE-2026-27978](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-mq59-m269-xvcx) is a different class of bug entirely. It’s a CSRF bypass in Next.js’s Server Action handling. Next.js validates that the `Origin` header matches the `Host` header to prevent cross-site request forgery. But when a request comes from a sandboxed `<iframe>`, the browser sends `Origin: null`.

The Next.js parser in `action-handler.ts` treated the string `'null'` as a missing origin rather than an explicit cross-origin indicator. So an attacker could embed a form inside a sandboxed iframe, submit it, and invoke Server Actions using the victim’s authenticated session cookies. Fixed in Next.js 16.1.7.

## What’s Still Exposed

The CVEs above have patches. But some of the risk is structural, baked into how Flight is designed to work.

### Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) On The Flight Stream

If an attacker can sit between server and client (CDN compromise, cache poisoning, rogue proxy), modifying the Flight stream in transit looks feasible. The format is plain text with a predictable structure.

Assuming stream control, an attacker could alter `$I` (Import) rows to redirect component loading to a different module in the webpack chunk map. They could inject `$F` (Server Reference) tags to embed hidden RPC triggers in the rendered UI. They could modify `D` (Data) rows to change component props, and if the target component uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, that’s a direct XSS vector.

Flight escapes `$` prefixes in user-supplied strings to prevent data from being interpreted as protocol instructions. But that only applies to data flowing through the serializer. A MITM attacker writes raw protocol directly into the stream. The escaping doesn’t help.

### Server Action Enumeration

Server Action IDs are obfuscated hashes generated at build time. They look random. But `server-reference-manifest.json` maps every action ID to its source implementation. A public manifest hands an attacker a complete API map. This exposure usually stems from misconfigured hosting, an exposed `.next` directory, or path traversal.

Known action IDs expose Server Actions to standard IDOR and parameter tampering attacks. An attacker can forge direct requests with manipulated arguments. Developers often trust these inputs blindly because they originate from React’s internal machinery. The architectural consequences of that misplaced trust will be the focus of my next piece.

### Encrypted Closure Tampering

When a Server Action captures variables from its surrounding scope (closures), Next.js encrypts them before sending to the client. The key is in `NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, AES with a base64-encoded key (16, 24, or 32 bytes). `decryptActionBoundArgs` handles decryption on each invocation.

By default, this key regenerates every build. But multi-server setups often use a static key. If an attacker gets file read access (path traversal, SSRF), they extract the key, decrypt the closure state, modify it (changing a `userId`, a `role`, a query parameter), and re-encrypt. The server accepts the forged closure as legitimate.

### Supply Chain Activation via Module IDs

I haven’t demonstrated this end-to-end, but the theory is straightforward.

Flight references client components by module ID, something like `["360","static/chunks/app/page-7f3480.js"]`. The bundler assigns these IDs at build time based on the module graph. A compromised npm package sitting in `node_modules` as a transitive dependency gets bundled into a chunk but never loaded because no component references it. Inert.

But if an attacker injects `$I` import references into the Flight stream (via MITM, cache poisoning, or server-side injection), the parser should load that dormant module. There may be chunk-level validation I’m not seeing. But if the module ID is valid and present in the manifest, I don’t see what stops it. The attack doesn’t require the package to be imported anywhere in your code. It just needs to exist in the bundle output.

## This Has Happened Before

React Flight isn’t the first framework to invent a custom serialization format for server-client communication and then discover it’s an attack surface. And it won’t be the last.

[Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](https://www.gwtproject.org/) used a custom RPC protocol to sync Java objects between browser and server. BishopFox demonstrated that attackers could manipulate the wire format to achieve arbitrary deserialization; GWT eventually disabled binary serialization entirely. It took years.

Java Server Faces (JSF) and ASP.NET both serialized **`ViewState`** to the client as a hidden form field. When cryptographic signing was weak or missing, attackers tampered with the serialized state and achieved remote code execution. Microsoft and Oracle patched it repeatedly. The underlying pattern kept resurfacing.

The pattern is always the same: a framework invents a custom wire format to move rich, stateful, sometimes executable data between server and client. The designers assume the server is the sole producer of that data and the client is a trusted consumer. Then someone demonstrates that the wire format can be manipulated in transit, or that the server can be tricked into deserializing attacker-controlled input. React Flight is the latest entry in this pattern. It is **not an anomaly**.

## Where This Goes Next

The React Flight protocol solves a genuinely hard problem: streaming interactive component trees from server to client in a way that enables progressive hydration, async data loading, and server-driven code splitting. It works. I don’t want to lose sight of that.

But it works by serializing executable references, async state, module pointers, and RPC endpoints over a streaming text protocol, and then trusting the structure of that stream on both ends. The React team has patched the known gadgets. The `hasOwnProperty` fix is correct. The DoS fixes are in place. The source code exposure bug is closed.

I think exposing arbitrary property traversal and executable Thenable reconstruction through a network-facing protocol was a **design mistake**. `$:`, `$@`, and `$B` are powerful internal primitives that were reachable through a parser that didn’t validate ownership of the properties it traversed. One check was missing, and the result was CVSS 10.0.

> [As more frameworks adopt server-driven UI patterns, the industry is going to need stronger primitives than “the server is trusted”: cryptographic validation of serialized payloads, signed component trees, and content integrity checks on the Flight stream itself.](https://twitter.com/share?text=%0aAs%20more%20frameworks%20adopt%20server-driven%20UI%20patterns,%20the%20industry%20is%20going%20to%20need%20stronger%20primitives%20than%20%e2%80%9cthe%20server%20is%20trusted%e2%80%9d:%20cryptographic%20validation%20of%20serialized%20payloads,%20signed%20component%20trees,%20and%20content%20integrity%20checks%20on%20the%20Flight%20stream%20itself.%0a&url=https://smashingmagazine.com%2f2026%2f07%2fweaponizing-defending-react-flight-protocol%2f)

Hoping the parser handles every edge case hasn’t worked historically, and I don’t see why it would start working now.

The code is in `react-client/src/ReactFlightClient.js`. If you ship Server Components, read it. Know what your framework is trusting on your behalf.
