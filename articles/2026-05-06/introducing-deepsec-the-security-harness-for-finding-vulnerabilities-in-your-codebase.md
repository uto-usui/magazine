Today we’re open sourcing [`deepsec`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/deepsec/): a security harness powered by coding agents. It runs on your own infrastructure and surfaces hard-to-find issues in large codebases.

You can run `deepsec` on your laptop without setting up a cloud service for privileged source code access. For inference, you can use your existing Claude or Codex subscription without any additional setup.

Scanning large repos can take multiple days on a single machine. To run research jobs in parallel, `deepsec` supports optional fanout to Vercel Sandboxes for remote execution. Scans on Vercel’s codebases routinely scale up to 1,000+ concurrent sandboxes.

## [Link to heading](#architecture)Architecture

At its core, `deepsec` uses `claude` and `codex` to perform tailored investigation of a codebase using Opus 4.7 at max effort and GPT 5.5 at xhigh reasoning.

Scans start with static analysis to identify security-sensitive files, then coding agents investigate each candidate, tracing data flows, checking for mitigations, and producing actionable findings with severity ratings. Here is the workflow:

-   **Scan**: It starts by performing a regex-only scan of all files for security-sensitive areas that subsequent steps will focus on.
    
-   **Investigate**: Agents investigate each file identified in the scan.
    
-   **Revalidate**: A second agent run validates investigation findings to remove false positives and reclassify severity.
    
-   **Enrich**: Once investigation is complete, an agent uses git metadata and other optional services to identify the contributors responsible for fixing each issue.
    
-   **Export**: The `export` command formats the findings as instructions so that they can be turned into tickets for humans and coding agents.

## [Link to heading](#running-deepsec-on-production-code)Running `deepsec` on production code

`deepsec` has been highly useful on our own monorepos and for our customers' codebases. During development, we ran `deepsec` on several open source repositories of Vercel customers and partners.

> We’ve been on a lookout for a tool to do security scans on our open source repositories. deepsec’s scan have been the most thorough, with most findings, and good true-positive rate.

For example, `deepsec` scanned the [open source version](https://github.com/dubinc/dub) of [dub.co](http://dub.co/). Dub is a marketing attribution platform for affiliate programs and short links that is also available as SaaS. It features authenticated access, interacts with a database, and runs several backend services, creating a large security surface. When we shared our `deepsec` findings with founder Steven Tey, he replied:

> We get a lot of automated security reports, but most of them aren't actionable. deepsec is the first tool that's surfaced the kind of issues we'd actually want a security engineer to flag, and it runs on infrastructure we control.

Running against Vercel’s own monorepos, `deepsec` identified subtle edge cases in auth conditions, leading us to develop a [custom scanner plugin](https://github.com/vercel-labs/deepsec/blob/main/docs/writing-matchers.md) that covers every authentication path in our code.

### [Link to heading](#false-positives-and-best-uses)False positives and best uses

Some of `deepsec`'s findings will be false positives. In our experience the false positive rate is roughly 10-20%. Given the impact of true positive findings in our own research, we’ve been happy with this outcome, and we built the `revalidate` step to have the agent further verify its findings to reduce false positives.

`deepsec` works best for applications and services. It may be usable for libraries and frameworks, but those would likely require custom prompts and scanners.

## [Link to heading](#customization-and-plugins)Customization and plugins

`deepsec` ships with a plugin system for adapting it to your codebase. The most common plugins are custom scanners: regex matchers tuned to your auth model, data layer, or team conventions. We recommend using `deepsec` with your coding agent and asking it to write those matchers based on findings from an initial scan:

```
Inspect previous runs against ./my-app.Are there custom deepsec matchers we should add to find more candidates for vulnerabilities?
```

## [Link to heading](#do-i-need-access-to-a-special-“cyber-model”)Do I need access to a special “cyber model”?

Both Anthropic and OpenAI offer “cyber” versions of their most capable models, fine-tuned to accept security tasks the base models won’t. `deepsec` works with these, but is also fully functional with off-the-shelf models.

`deepsec` ships with a classifier that checks whether the task was refused after each research step. In our experience, for the prompt that `deepsec` is using, refusals are a non-issue for both Opus 4.7 and GPT 5.5.

## [Link to heading](#getting-started)Getting started

To get started, run `npx deepsec init` at the root of your repository. This will create a directory called `./.deepsec`, which is used to configure the system and store a catalog of your `deepsec` investigations. From there, follow the output of the command. Read the full [documentation on Github](https://github.com/vercel-labs/deepsec/#docs).

While we’ve used `deepsec` extensively, it is still early in its development. Feedback and contributions [on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel-labs/deepsec/) are welcome.
