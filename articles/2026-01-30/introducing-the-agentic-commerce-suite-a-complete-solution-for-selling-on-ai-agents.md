In September, we announced the [Agentic Commerce Protocol](https://www.agenticcommerce.dev/) (ACP), the first live standard that enables programmatic commerce flows between AI agents and businesses. While ACP creates industry standards for agentic transactions, your business still faces a heavy integration lift to participate in agentic commerce. You have to build and maintain public ACP endpoints with proper versioning and access controls, navigate each agent’s unique catalog specifications and API requirements, and integrate your existing commerce stack with AI agent workflows. This can take up to six months for every new AI agent you support.

Today, we’re introducing the Agentic Commerce Suite: a new solution that gets your business agent-ready. It enables you to sell on AI agents more easily by making your products discoverable, simplifying your checkout, and allowing you to accept agentic payments via a single integration.

To get started, you simply connect your product catalog to Stripe and then, in the Stripe Dashboard, select which AI agents you’d like to sell through. From there, Stripe helps with discovery, checkout, payments, and fraud detection, and will send you order events so you can continue using your existing commerce stack. All components of the Agentic Commerce Suite are modular by default, so you can pick and choose what best meets the needs of your business. 

Leading brands are already onboarding to the Agentic Commerce Suite, such as URBN (including Anthropologie, Free People, and Urban Outfitters), Etsy, Ashley Furniture, Coach, Kate Spade, Nectar, Revolve, Halara, and Abt Electronics.  

“At Etsy, our responsibility is to ensure that our sellers’ work can be discovered wherever buyers choose to shop. Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite offers an integration solution that makes this easier than ever, enabling us to surface sellers’ unique items to buyers across platforms,” said Rafe Colburn, chief product and technology officer at Etsy. 

The Agentic Commerce Suite will be rolling out to businesses via the Stripe Dashboard and Stripe APIs; through ecommerce platforms such as Wix, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Squarespace, and commercetools; and via omnichannel commerce platforms such as Akeneo, Cymbio, Logicbroker, Mirakl, Pipe17, and Rithum.

“Agentic shopping is transforming how people discover and buy products. With Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite, Squarespace merchants will be able to effortlessly bring their products into AI agents, unlocking a new way to grow their businesses,” said Dan Chandre, senior vice president of commercial at Squarespace. 

Here’s a closer look at how the Agentic Commerce Suite works.

## Make your products discoverable by AI agents 

One of the most common questions we hear from businesses today is simple: “How do I get discovered by AI agents?” Businesses want to be discovered through new agentic channels, but they don’t want to build custom capabilities for each agent, maintain dozens of bespoke catalogs and APIs, or manage ongoing changes as standards evolve. 

The Agentic Commerce Suite solves this by giving you a dedicated hosted ACP endpoint, allowing you to share near real-time product, price, and availability information with AI agents—with minimal changes required to your existing systems. You can upload your product catalog directly to Stripe or connect your existing product catalog from leading product syndicators. We can then syndicate your product information to each AI agent, and with one click, you can automatically start taking payments across any supported agent.

## Simplify your checkout and retain control of your customer experience

Once your products are discoverable, you then need to make sure your existing commerce stack can support taxes, shipping calculations, order management, and fulfillment for agentic transactions. This would require you to build and maintain a complex interoperability layer between your systems and individual AI agents.

The Agentic Commerce Suite is powered by Stripe’s Checkout Sessions API, which helps with aspects of the checkout, including shipping and taxes. You can choose to have Stripe manage this on your behalf via built-in Stripe products, such as Stripe Tax, or you can use your existing commerce stack to upload tax codes, manage near real-time inventory checks, and set dynamic shipping rates—with minimal changes to your systems.

This flexibility extends post-purchase. Once a customer completes an agentic transaction, you simply use your existing in-house order and fulfillment process. As the merchant of record, you also retain all control over customer relationships, including how refunds and disputes are managed.

## Accept agentic payments and protect against new fraud patterns

Agentic commerce is reshaping fraud detection. Fraud signals tuned to human traffic are becoming outdated; AI agents lack human variability and can be misflagged as fraudulent. There’s also the possibility for new fraud patterns, as agents can be manipulated by bad actors to place risky orders or bypass normal guardrails. Without the proper systems in place, businesses accepting agentic payments spend more resources fighting fraud, leading to lost revenue, increased chargebacks, and eroded customer trust.

To help protect businesses, the Agentic Commerce Suite handles and processes [Shared Payment Tokens (SPTs)](https://docs.stripe.com/agentic-commerce/concepts/shared-payment-tokens), a new payment primitive for agentic commerce. AI agents use SPTs to initiate payments using a buyer’s saved payment method without exposing payment credentials. Every token can be scoped to a specific seller, bounded by time and amount, and observable throughout its lifecycle to prevent unauthorized agent actions and reduce the likelihood of disputes. 

When used on Stripe, SPTs can also be powered by [Stripe Radar](https://stripe.com/radar) to relay the underlying risk signals—including the likelihood of a fraudulent dispute, card testing, a stolen card, a card issuer decline, and other fraud signals—using transaction and payment method details that help differentiate between high-intent agents and low-trust automated bots.
