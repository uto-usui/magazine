When and how CSS custom properties are calculated might not be what you expect, and it has a big impact on your styles.

## [The default](#the-default)

Take this HTML:

```
<div></div><div class="second-item">    <p>…</p></div>
```

And this CSS:

```
.second-item {    --index: sibling-index();    & > :first-child {        scale: var(--index);    }}
```

If you're unfamiliar with `sibling-index()`, here's a quick video intro I posted recently:

The question is, how much is the paragraph going to scale?

`sibling-index()` is 1-indexed, but is it going to pick up the index of the second div - where the custom property is defined, or its first child - where the custom property is used? The answer is: it depends.

If the code is taken in isolation, the value of the custom property will be stored as a token stream, so it's computed a little like this:

```
.second-item {    --index: sibling-index();    /* …Which is computed to: */    --index: sibling-index();    /* (as in, no change) */    & > :first-child {        scale: var(--index);        /* …Which is substituted for: */        scale: sibling-index();        /* …Which computes to: */        scale: 1;    }}
```

So the `var()` is substituted for `sibling-index()`, which is evaluated in that context. Since the paragraph is the first child of its parent, it will scale by 1.

This is reflected in `getComputedStyle()`:

```
const div = document.querySelector('.second-item');console.log(getComputedStyle(div).getPropertyValue('--index'));// Logs: "sibling-index()"
```

But that's just the default…

## [Changing the default](#changing-the-default)

Let's register that custom property:

```
@property --index {    syntax: '<number>';    inherits: true;    initial-value: 0;}
```

Custom properties you haven't registered behave as if they have `syntax: '*'`, meaning 'anything', which computes to a token stream as before. But here we're using `'<number>'`, meaning it computes the value as a number:

```
.second-item {    --index: sibling-index();    /* …Which is computed to: */    --index: 2;    & > :first-child {        scale: var(--index);        /* …Which is substituted for: */        scale: 2;        /* …Which computes to: */        scale: 2;    }}
```

Registering the custom property & giving it a syntax meant the value was computed earlier, in a different context, so the result was different.

Again, this is reflected in `getComputedStyle()`:

```
const div = document.querySelector('.second-item');console.log(getComputedStyle(div).getPropertyValue('--index'));// Logs: "2"
```

And it's not just `sibling-index()` that behaves this way. This also impacts relative font units (`em`, `ex`, `ch`, `cap`, `lh` etc.), container query units (`cqw`, `cqi`, `cqb` etc.), and more.

Another thing that's impacted, although slightly differently, is URLs. In CSS, URLs are generally resolved against the stylesheet's base URL at computed-value time - so if a token-stream custom property is defined in one stylesheet and `var()`'d from another, the URL resolves against the consuming stylesheet. Registering the custom property with `syntax: '<url>'` pins it to the stylesheet that declared it.

## [But what about var()?](#but-what-about-var)

Here's a trickier example:

```
.second-item {    --multiplier: 1;    --index: calc(sibling-index() * var(--multiplier));    & > :first-child {        --multiplier: 3;        scale: var(--index);    }}
```

What happens here? Well, `var()` behaves differently to `sibling-index()`. `var()` is an ["arbitrary substitution function"](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-5/#arbitrary-substitution-function), along with a bunch of other functions like `if()`, `attr()`, and `ident()`. These are substituted immediately, regardless of the syntax of the custom property. So:

```
.second-item {    --multiplier: 1;    --index: calc(sibling-index() * var(--multiplier));    /* …Which is substituted for: */    --index: calc(sibling-index() * 1);}
```

What happens next depends on the defined syntax of `--index`. It'll either stay as the above token stream, or it'll compute down to `2` - the same rules as before. In both cases, `--multiplier: 3` on the child is ignored.

This was a detail of CSS that I sort-of half-knew, as in, I knew `@property` changed computation timing somehow, but I hadn't fully understood when or how, until I looked it up today. I hope you understand it now too!
