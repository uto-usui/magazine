Strong UX ideas do not secure investment on their own. Through a worked example, Alex Williams breaks down how to define business value, calculate costs, test causality, and build a credible case for the return on a design initiative.

Sooner or later, a CFO looks at your wireframes and asks what any of it actually _does_ for the bottom line. Storyboards don’t answer that question, and the era when a 5-minute pitch could answer it ended, unfortunately, a while ago.

These days, [if you want to win budget, buy-in, and backing for UX](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/12/tools-tips-resources-to-build-better-user-experiences/), the design has to be provably good for the business, not only for the people using it.

And proving that takes more than taping a dollar sign to a redesign. You have to understand how your organization defines value in the first place, how it measures that value, and how a credible line gets drawn between a design initiative and an outcome leadership already cares about.

Rather than scatter tips, this article follows one worked example the whole way through. Meridian is a mid-size B2B SaaS company, and it is entirely made up — that label matters, so it gets repeated where it counts. Its onboarding redesign carries the same figures from **goal-setting** through **cost accounting**, **causal testing**, and the final **ROI number**, because a framework only becomes tangible when the numbers connect. Every step is one you can rerun inside your own organization.

## Why ROI Matters More Than Ever in UX Conversations

Companies now want clarity on what every dollar buys, and “delightful user experiences” stopped clearing that bar some time ago. I still remember a former colleague celebrating a $1 million redesign he’d gotten greenlit mostly on the strength of a couple of three.js tricks. Try that pitch in front of a finance team today and see how far the particles get you.

[Executives don’t hate UX, they just hate vagueness](https://uxplaybook.org/articles/10-ways-ux-managers-lose-credibility). A pitch built on “users will find it easier” loses, every time, to the department promising 12% more sales in Q3. The difference is the one between [a streamlined checkout flow that reduced cart abandonment](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/sunuva-case-study-ux-changes-result-increase-conversion/) with completed purchases up 22%, and the same work rewarded with “the QA testers like it.” One of those goes on your resume. The rest of this article is about earning the first version, with Meridian’s numbers doing the work.

## When Business Goals And KPIs Don’t Exist Yet

Most writing about UX ROI makes a convenient assumption: that the organization **already** owns clean business goals and KPIs for you to hook your work onto. Real companies are messier than that. Plenty run on ambitions like “grow faster” or “[improve the customer journey](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/01/all-about-customer-journey-mapping/)” that nobody ever broke into anything measurable, and an ROI case built on that ambiguity sounds impressive right up until somebody scrutinizes it.

So the first job is often to [help the organization define what success even looks like](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/calculating-roi-design-projects/). Interview stakeholders across departments — what does product consider a good quarter, where does customer success watch users struggle, where do sales deals stall — and listen for the themes that keep resurfacing across conversations, because those recurring themes are the company’s latent business objectives. A useful forcing function [is the OKR model (Objectives and Key Results)](https://rework.withgoogle.com/intl/en/guides/set-goals-with-okrs), which doesn’t tolerate vagueness.

At Meridian, the stated ambition was _“improve the rate of new users’ adoption of the platform,”_ which you can neither design toward nor measure against. Interviews turned up the real shape of the problem. Trial users needed a median of 14 days to reach first value, most churned before getting there, and onboarding questions were burying the support queue. Out of that came an OKR with actual edges: reduce median time-to-first-value from 14 days to 7 with the use of a guided setup flow, and lift trial-to-paid conversion from 8% to 9.5%.

**One warning about formalizing KPIs**: Impose them from inside the UX team and leadership will suspect you’ve rigged the field in your own favor, so co-create them with whoever owns the outcome — though never at the price of accepting targets that set your team up for an uncomfortable situation. Meridian’s head of product agreed that setup-completion rate was a fair proxy for onboarding usability, and customer success signed off on time-to-first-value, a number already sitting on their own dashboard.

> A KPI ladder that ends at a metric somebody already watches buys you credibility before any design work starts.

## Quantifying The Full Cost Of The Investment

ROI has a **denominator**, and the denominator is where most UX teams go wrong. You can’t calculate a return [without strategic financial planning](https://www.farseer.com/blog/strategic-financial-planning/), yet cost usually gets counted as designer salaries or consulting hours and nothing else. A finance team will find the rest whether or not you counted it, so **count it first**.

Direct costs are the visible ones. Meridian’s redesign ran $45,000 in design and research labor plus another $8,000 in tooling and participant incentives. [Licenses for Figma](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2025/04/anima-playground-figma-designs-live-apps/), UserTesting, Hotjar, analytics platforms, research incentive spend — all of it belongs in the total, and that’s before the [inevitable instances of vendor lock-in](https://cast.ai/blog/vendor-lock-in-and-how-to-break-free/) every UX team eventually faces. Engineering sits in the same column, because [a UX redesign doesn’t stop at the mockup](https://uxmastery.com/the-biggest-mistake-new-ux-designers-make/). Building the guided setup took two frontend sprints plus a QA pass, $38,000 worth, and the project generated about $4,000 of coordination overhead along the way in new syncs and shared dashboards.

The line item nearly everyone misses, and the one worth stealing from this article if you steal nothing else, is **stakeholder time**. Workshops, design reviews, and feedback sessions all pull senior people away from their primary work. A VP of Product spending four hours a week in UX reviews is a VP not spending those hours on roadmap planning or partner negotiations. Log the attendance — who came, for how long, at what seniority — and price it at fully loaded cost, meaning salary plus benefits divided by productive hours. A quarter’s worth of workshops, reviews, and interviews at Meridian priced out at $22,000.

Add it all up: $45,000 in design labor, $8,000 in tooling, $38,000 in engineering, $22,000 in stakeholder time, $4,000 in coordination. The investment is $117,000. Saying that number out loud beats saying “we spent $45K on design,” precisely because it already includes everything a finance team would have dug up on its own.

## Proving Causation, Not Just Correlation

Most UX ROI pitches die right here. Conversions rose after the redesign, sure — and the CFO wants to know how you ruled out the new pricing, the seasonal traffic bump, and the marketing campaign that shipped the same week. Without a convincing answer, [your entire ROI story crumbles](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/09/formula-roi-design-system/).

After all these years, [the gold standard for proving causation is still A/B testing](https://hbr.org/2017/06/a-refresher-on-ab-testing): run the old experience against the new one on an even traffic split until the sample means something.

Onboarding happens to suit a phased rollout, which is why Meridian could do this cleanly. For eight weeks, half of new trial signups received the redesigned guided setup while half stayed on the legacy flow. Control converted to paid at 8.0%. The variant came in at 9.4%. With roughly 6,100 trials inside the window, the difference was statistically significant, but a 1.4-point gap on a single test is still the kind of result that deserves a second look before anyone builds a budget on it, which is one reason the team held back on attribution below. Where a split isn’t feasible — a change too structural, a user base too small — fall back to a **time series** instead. Measure steadily for weeks before the change, implement, then keep measuring against the baseline you established.

Documenting whatever else happens [around the same time as your UX change](https://medium.com/@divinestocks/how-to-document-frequent-design-changes-in-ux-projects-without-losing-control-93be5d70c9ed) is the unglamorous half of causation.

A pricing-page test from Meridian’s marketing team overlapped weeks five through eight of the rollout. The UX team noted it, confirmed it hit both cohorts evenly, and still chose to attribute only 70% of the observed lift to the redesign in the final math. There is no formula that produces that number; treat it as an illustrative assumption for this example.

The team asked how much of the lift could plausibly belong to the pricing test if it had helped one cohort slightly more than the other, settled on a ceiling of about a third, and rounded the redesign’s share down to 70%. Your figure will differ. What matters is that it is written down and argued for before the results arrive, not fitted to them afterwards. That restraint is worth money in a skeptical room. _“We attribute roughly 70% of the lift to the onboarding change, with the remainder likely influenced by concurrent pricing work”_ survives cross-examination; claiming everything does not. Cohort analysis then backed the number up, since the lift held across acquisition channels and tenure bands, and at that point the skeptics had very little left to work with.

Leading and lagging indicators belong on the same slide, because each covers the other’s weakness. Meridian’s leading indicators moved first — setup completion climbed from 62% to 89%, median time-to-first-value dropped from 14 days to 6.5 — and the lagging trial-to-paid number followed. Mechanism first, business outcome second. Presented together, they form a [causal chain that’s harder to poke holes in](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-metrics/) than either one alone.

## The ROI Calculation, End to End

So what did Meridian actually earn? The company sees about 40,000 trial signups a year. Lifting conversion from 8.0% to 9.4% adds roughly 560 paying customers annually, and at an average of $1,800 in annual recurring revenue per account, those customers represent about $1,008,000 in new ARR. Applying the conservative 70% attribution from the causal work trims the defensible figure to roughly $706,000.

Set that against the full $117,000 investment and the first-year ROI lands near 5:1, with payback arriving in roughly two months. There’s a second line, too. Onboarding-related support tickets dropped about 30%, some 3,600 fewer tickets a year, worth another $54,000 annually at $15 per resolved ticket. Keep it as its own line rather than folding it into one swollen headline number. The case reads as more honest that way and loses none of its force.

Three assumptions carry that result, and each belongs on the slide next to it. The 40,000 signups and the $1,800 average ARR are the prior year’s actuals held flat, so a growth or pricing change moves the outcome in either direction. The 70% attribution is the illustrative assumption from the causal work, not a measured quantity. And the two-month payback counts new ARR as it lands rather than revenue recognized net of churn, which flatters the timeline; on a net basis the payback stretches to roughly a quarter. State those three plainly and a finance team can adapt the example to its own numbers. Hide them and the whole thing starts to look like marketing math, however careful the experiment was.

What persuades in the final presentation is not sophistication. Open with the baseline: what stalled trials and support volume were already costing. Show the delta in terms leadership reads fluently, [metrics like conversion rate uplift](https://useinsider.com/glossary/conversion-rate-uplift/) chief among them. A chart of setup completion climbing from 62% to 89% will beat a paragraph of UX jargon, and a translation like _“each abandoned setup costs us 0.3 support tickets”_ beats the chart. Above all, keep every figure identical from the first slide to the last. A room full of finance people forgives many things, but never numbers that wobble between slides.

## Tailoring The Case To Whoever Holds The Purse Strings

Budget decisions come out of coalitions. A CFO may hold the final say when [adding AI to the checkout process](https://omniga.ai/blog/finance-os/systems-security/ai-finance-tech-stack-startups-2025), but marketing, product, and customer success all lean on that decision, and **each means something different by “value.”**

A CFO hears cost, revenue, and risk. A CMO hears conversion and acquisition cost, since [UX is a lever for increasing marketing ROI](https://www.coremountainmedia.com/insights/ux-marketing-roi). Product counts support tickets; customer success thinks in retention. The underlying numbers never change; only the framing rotates, and [a CFO wants a projection, not a moodboard](https://tgg-accounting.com/how-to-build-cfo-dashboard/). Meridian’s CFO slide read _“the onboarding redesign protects roughly $706,000 in new ARR a year against a $117,000 investment,”_ while the CMO version led with what a 9.4% trial conversion does to blended acquisition cost.

## Beyond the Dollar Sign: Qualitative and Non-Financial Metrics

Some UX outcomes never translate cleanly into revenue, and pretending they do weakens the parts of your case that are solid.

> The trick with qualitative evidence is collecting it rigorously enough that nobody can wave it off as anecdote.

Scores like [Net Promoter Score (NPS)](https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/customer/net-promoter-score/), CSAT, and Customer Effort Score already sit inside most reporting cadences, which makes them cheap to borrow. Tie your work to their movement, and segment wherever the data allows.

Meridian could say that NPS among trial users on the redesigned onboarding was 51 against 34 for the legacy flow, which lands far harder than any blended average. Verbatim feedback from surveys, support transcripts, and app store reviews adds the emotional weight the scores lack. Internal tools deserve the same discipline, [since employee experience is increasingly recognized as a business driver](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidarmano/2021/05/13/why-employee-experience-is-the-new-customer-experience-five-factors-driving-change-at-work/) — a dashboard redesign that hands account managers 45 minutes a day back is a productivity gain, a satisfaction gain, and a retention lever all in one.

Brand perception resists direct measurement but leaves tracks in repeat visits, organic referrals, and social sentiment. It carries extra weight [in trust-sensitive industries like finance or healthcare](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07359683.2025.2564584), and it forms fast, given that [UX design influences the first impressions of a whopping 94% of customers](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/web-design-statistics).

Whatever you collect, **systematize the collecting**. Run pre- and post-surveys with consistent question sets, [use structured usability testing](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/usability-testing.html) with task-based scoring, and put the qualitative right next to the quantitative when you present.

> “Setup completion rose from 62% to 89%, and in post-test interviews 8 of 10 participants called the new flow intuitive, against 3 of 10 for the old one” — a pairing like that is much harder to dismiss than either half on its own.

## Making the Case Stick

[UX loses the budget battle unless it’s mapped to company-wide objectives](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/making-ux-research-essential-to-your-companys-success), so phrase the proposal in the words of this year’s board presentation.

Nobody at Meridian pitched “simplify the onboarding UI”; the pitch was a redesigned trial experience worth 1.4 points of upgrade rate, roughly $1M in annual recurring revenue before attribution. Bring evidence in both registers, since [that is what social proof is for](https://www.agilitypr.com/pr-news/public-relations/9-ways-to-use-social-proof-to-increase-your-conversions/): the case, clearly labeled, plus screenshots, impact graphs, and user quotes. Find [internal allies who can repeat the ROI narrative](https://mimischeibe.com/storytelling-ux-design-leadership/) in rooms you’ll never enter, and write the playbook down, because **repeatable ROI is what earns recurring investment**.

## Resources for Going Deeper

This topic has been explored extensively by researchers, practitioners, and consultancies. Here’s a curated set of resources worth studying if you want to build a stronger ROI practice around UX.

-   [“Measuring the User Experience” by Tom Tullis and Bill Albert](https://www.elsevier.com/books/measuring-the-user-experience/tullis/978-0-12-415781-1) is the definitive guide to UX metrics. It covers everything from task-based measurements to survey design to statistical analysis, and it’s written for practitioners, not academics.
-   [Jared Spool’s “The $300 Million Button” case study](https://yourstory.com/2026/02/300-million-button-checkout-behaviour) is a classic example of how a single UX change (removing a mandatory registration step) generated massive revenue uplift. It’s a story every UX professional should have in their back pocket.
-   [Forrester’s research on UX ROI](https://www.forrester.com/report/the-six-steps-for-justifying-better-ux/RES117708) provides enterprise-focused frameworks for building business cases around experience design, including their widely cited finding that every dollar invested in UX returns $100.
-   [“UX Strategy” by Jaime Levy](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ux-strategy-2nd/9781492052425/) bridges the gap between design thinking and business strategy, offering practical tools for aligning UX initiatives with organizational goals and market positioning.
-   [The Design Value Index by the Design Management Institute](https://www.dmi.org/page/DesignValue) tracks publicly traded companies that invest heavily in design against the S&P 500. The data consistently shows that design-led companies outperform the index by significant margins, and it’s a powerful data point for executive presentations.
-   [Google’s HEART framework](https://research.google/pubs/pub36299/) provides a structured approach to selecting UX metrics at scale. HEART stands for Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, and Task success, and it’s particularly useful for teams that struggle to decide which metrics to track.

## Conclusion

A seat at the table never comes from beauty or novelty. It comes from **measurable, defensible impact**, which means UX leaders have to trade the artist’s posture for the strategist’s. Speak in outcomes rather than outputs. Connect pixels to profit.

When someone challenges the numbers, don’t flinch. Show the controlled experiment, the cohort analysis, and the before-and-after metrics, every figure holding steady from the first slide to the last, the way Meridian’s did, with the customer quotes and the employee-satisfaction data sitting right beside the revenue impact. Prove the work does more than delight users, and be ready to defend the ratio line by line. That’s when the CFO leans in, and that’s when design stops being optional.
