You can now emit your own metrics directly from your Vercel Functions and analyze them alongside Vercel's built-in observability data.

Use the `metric()` function from the `@vercel/functions` package to record any value you care about, like request latency or business events, and attach attributes to filter and group by:

```
import { metric } from "@vercel/functions";metric("database.query_ms", 120, {  table: "my-table",  db: "my-database"});
```

Once emitted, your custom metrics are available across Observability:  
• **Query builder:** slice and aggregate metrics on the fly.  
• **Notebooks:** build and share dashboards.  
• **CLI:** query using the `vc metrics` command.

Vercel automatically adds useful attributes like the source deployment and function region. Custom metrics are billed as observability events and available on Pro and Enterprise with Observability Plus.
