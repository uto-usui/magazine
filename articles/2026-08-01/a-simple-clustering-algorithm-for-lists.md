I’ve been experimenting with a human-friendly way to cluster list values using reversals of sub-lists. Or, in normal human words: I was playing with my toddler’s [Magna-Tiles](https://magnatiles.com/) and got into a pattern with how I was sorting and grouping them, and turned it into a little… algorithm? Heuristic? Anyway, look!

Here’s a video I made for reference:

But if you prefer words over video: Let’s say you have a list where node values can be `b`, `g`, `o`, or `r`.

Initial state: `bgogbrbroorrgbgorrbggo`

What you do is you take the value that’s at the end (in this case `o`), and you find the next value closest to the end with that same value, and you reverse the sub-list between them. So, the next iteration would be:

```
bgogbrbroorrgbgooggbrr
                ▲    ▲
                └──┬─┘
                this part was reversed
```

We reversed everything to the right of the second `o` from the right.

And then, you do the same thing, now that `r` group is at the end, you reverse the sub-list to the next `r`:

```
bgogbrbroorrrrbggoogbg
            ▲        ▲
	          └────┬───┘
            this part was reversed
```

And so on:

```
bgogbrbroorrrrbggooggb (reverse on the g)
bgogbrbroorrrrbbggoogg (reverse on the b)
bgogbrbroorrrrbbggggoo (reverse on the g again)
bgogbrbrooooggggbbrrrr
bgogbrbrrrrrbbggggoooo
bgoooooggggbbrrrrrbrbg
bgooooogggggbrbrrrrrbb
bgooooogggggbrbbbrrrrr
bgooooogggggbrrrrrrbbb
bgooooogggggbbbbrrrrrr
```

And at this point, because the `r`s are done, you’d go to the next group that is incomplete from the right, and reverse:

```
bgooooogggggrrrrrrbbbb
            ▲        ▲
	          └────┬───┘
            this part was reversed,
            because b is still incomplete
```

Then continue normally:

```
bbbbbrrrrrrgggggooooog
bbbbbrrrrrrggggggooooo (final, clustered state)
```

It’s not the most efficient, but it’s very interesting. It’s “greedy” because it focuses on just the current optimizations at each step. I tried looking up similar ideas and I think it is closest to [pancake sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_sorting) (which is more around sorting, not grouping, and focused on a stack rather than a list, but otherwise has a lot of other similar concepts).

## Code!

I wrote an actual function for this **without AI** as a fun little brain exercise and it was exhausting, I admit (I haven’t written any sort of sorting algorithm from scratch in a _minute_). It took me some trial and error to clean up. It’s got `O(n^2)` time complexity (because I used nested while loops). I tried it with recursion at first (because it felt like it could be similar to merge sort when I was first noodling on it), and found that this way worked better.

Here’s what I ended up with, with some of comments for clarity:

```
function cassidyCluster(input) {
	// It's more "proper" to input an actual array here
	// but this is for accepting a string as well
	const list = typeof input === "string" ? input.split("") : [...input];
	const listLength = list.length;

	// Helper to reverse a portion of the list
	function reverse(arr, left, right) {
		while (left < right) {
			[arr[left], arr[right]] = [arr[right], arr[left]];
			left++;
			right--;
		}
	}

	while (true) {
		let right = listLength - 1;
		let clusterStartingIndex;
		let frontOfReversingSection;

		// Get the rightmost cluster of identical elements
		while (right > 0) {
			const target = list[right];
			clusterStartingIndex = right;

			while (
				clusterStartingIndex > 0 &&
				list[clusterStartingIndex - 1] === target
			) {
				clusterStartingIndex--;
			}
			frontOfReversingSection = clusterStartingIndex - 1;
			while (
				frontOfReversingSection >= 0 &&
				list[frontOfReversingSection] !== target
			) {
				frontOfReversingSection--;
			}

			if (frontOfReversingSection >= 0) break;

			right = clusterStartingIndex - 1;
		}

		// If no more clusters need to be completed, break
		if (right <= 0) break;

		if (right < listLength - 1) {
			// When the rightmost cluster is "done", reverse the section
			// of the list that includes the next cluster to be completed
			reverse(list, clusterStartingIndex, listLength - 1);
		} else {
			// Base case: reverse the section of the list that matches
			// the rightmost cluster
			reverse(list, frontOfReversingSection + 1, listLength - 1);
		}
	}
	return list;
}
```

## Humans are neat

I think this is a really interesting problem in that… it’s way easier to solve this as a physical human being with objects in front of you than it is for a computer to solve it.

Computers don’t easily understand how to grab a group and flip them as we do. Our eyeballs have the “`O(1)` read” of the state in front of us, and we can just flip the pieces in one “move”.

Anyway, I’m _certain_ that someone out there will tell me that this is inefficient and pointless, because it kind of is… **but** I had a great time messing with this while playing with my kiddos. Go math!
