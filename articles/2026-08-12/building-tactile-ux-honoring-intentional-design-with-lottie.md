When tasked with building a highly interactive, tactile web experience, the architecture must serve the art direction. In this article, Alexey Kopytin explains their architectural rationale for building a digital stress-relief squeeze toy game using Lottie animations, DOM events, and distance-based math to maintain absolute control over their designers’ intentional motion.

When front-end developers and UX engineers are tasked with building a web interface that feels tactile, bouncy, or destructive, the industry instinct is almost always the same: reach for a physics engine. Frameworks like Matter.js, Cannon.js, or custom WebGL solutions have become the gold standard for creating immersive, gamified websites.

When our team at [Isadora Agency](https://isadoradigitalagency.com/) set out to build Stress Release, a digital stress-relief squeeze toy designed to let burnt-out creatives smash, stretch, and distort animated UI characters, we initially explored that route. The goal was to build a **highly tactile experience** where every click yielded a satisfying, squishy reaction.

But as we began prototyping, we realized something crucial: Physics engines produce plausible motion, but in our case, the animators produced **intentional motion**.

We didn’t need our characters to act like realistic rubber balls bouncing uncontrollably around a canvas. We needed them to react in very specific, highly designed ways. So, we scrapped the physics engine entirely.

In this article, we’ll break down how we built a real-time stress-relief squeeze toy **without a single line of WebGL or Matter.js**, relying entirely on programmatic Lottie state controls, DOM manipulation, and distance-based math.

## The Design Requirements: Intentional Motion

Our core requirement for _Stress Release_ was **absolute deterministic control**. Our animators had crafted bespoke `.json` Lottie files that required exact, frame-by-frame sequencing.

For instance, our ‘mega squeeze’ reaction required a precise 181-frame build-up followed by a specific release sequence. To honor this design, we needed an architecture that wouldn’t overwrite the animators’ crafted keyframes with algorithmic approximations.

The tighter the click-feedback loop (click → squish → score), the more you need deterministic frame control. By choosing programmatic state control using Lottie’s native API, we ensured that the interaction layer acted as a flawless trigger for the animation layer.

## Creating Tactile Feedback: Mapping DOM Elements To Lottie States

Because our architecture relied on Lottie and the standard DOM, rendering is handled directly by the Lottie runtime, which plays the JSON-based vector animations as SVGs internally. We selected elements directly by ID and CSS class, driving their behavior using a combination of Lottie animation segments, CSS transforms, and click-event math.

To achieve a deeply satisfying “tactile feel” upon hitting a character, we used **radial input mapping**. The first step was converting the click from page coordinates into the character’s local coordinate space.

Every click was measured against the character’s center point, then translated into score, feedback intensity, and explosion placement:

```
// Character's center point in its own coordinate space
var x_center = parseFloat($("#playChar").width()  / 2);
var y_center = parseFloat($("#playChar").height() / 2);

// Click position relative to the character's top-left corner
var offset = $("#playChar").offset(); // document-relative position
var X = parseFloat(e.pageX - offset.left);
var Y = parseFloat(e.pageY - offset.top);

// Vector from center to click point
var a = parseFloat(X - x_center);
var b = parseFloat(Y - y_center);
```

Then we calculate the straight-line distance from the center of the click using the Pythagorean theorem:

```
var distance = Math.hypot(a, b);
```

That single number drives everything: the score, the feedback intensity, and where the explosion animation appears:

```
// Distance zones map to point rewards
if      (distance < 10)  givePts = 100; // bullseye
else if (distance < 40)  givePts = getRndInteger(70, 90);
else if (distance < 70)  givePts = getRndInteger(40, 70);
else if (distance < 100) givePts = getRndInteger(20, 40);
else if (distance < 120) givePts = getRndInteger(10, 20);
else if (distance < 145) givePts = getRndInteger(1,  10);
else givePts = 0; // miss

// Explosion Lottie repositioned to the exact click point
var shiftPosition = window.innerWidth < 1023 ? -20 : 200;
$("#explosionChar").css({
  "margin-left": a + shiftPosition + "px",
  "margin-top":  b + shiftPosition + "px",
});

// Fire the squish animation instantly
explosion.goToAndPlay(0);
```

The result is a concentric zone system — a perfect circle of scoring rings around the character’s center, similar to a dartboard. The visual complexity of the Lottie SVG is completely irrelevant to hit detection; the hitbox is always a clean circle. Critically, the explosion Lottie animation is repositioned to (a, b) — the same vector used for scoring, so it always appears exactly where the player clicked. This spatial accuracy creates the tactile _“I hit that”_ sensation entirely through math and DOM positioning.

## Interaction Handling: Controlling The Narrative

Because the experience used DOM-managed SVG elements, desktop clicks and mobile taps could be handled directly through native event listeners. This avoided extra raycasting or coordinate remapping layers, while keeping the interaction model aligned with how the animations were rendered.

Since the game requires a visual reaction at a specific point, Lottie handles all the squish and bounce feelings internally through its animation curves. Each character has a defined set of animation sections (idle loops, reaction frames, and end states) stored as frame ranges. When a click lands, we jump directly to the exact segment that matches the current game state:

```
// Animation sections defined as frame ranges per character
const play_segments = [{
  charId: 0,
  sections: {
    idle:     [0,  40],   // looping idle state
    squeeze1: [41, 80],   // light reaction
    squeeze2: [81, 120],  // medium reaction
    squeeze3: [121, 160], // heavy reaction
  },
  playOrder: ["squeeze1", "squeeze2", "squeeze3"],
  endAnimation: [161, 200]
}];
```

On every click, we advance through the play order and fire the next segment:

```
function stepAnim() {
  let p         = play_segments[0];
  let i         = p["playOrder"][curr_order_play];
  let playNow   = p["sections"][i];

  playChar.stop();                    // halt current segment immediately
  playChar.loop = false;              // no looping - play once and stop
  playChar.playSegments(playNow, true); // jump to exact frames, force immediately

  curr_order_play++;
  canPlayAnim = 0;                    // lock out further clicks mid-animation

  if (curr_order_play > p["playOrder"].length - 1) {
    curr_order_play = 0;              // cycle back to start of sequence
  }
}
```

When the segment completes, control returns to the idle loop:

```
playChar.onComplete = function() {
  canPlayAnim = 1;          // unlock clicks again
  if (!playEnd) playIdleState();
};

function playIdleState() {
  playChar.playSegments([0, 40], true); // return to idle loop
  playChar.loop = true;
}
```

By triggering precise Lottie animation segments programmatically, the interaction layer maintains deterministic control over every squash and distortion state. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/building-tactile-ux-honoring-intentional-design-lottie/04-interaction-handling.png))

And for the mega squeeze build-up, the bar loops on a specific frame range until triggered:

```
// Loop the "ready to release" frames until player activates
indikL.loop = true;
indikL.playSegments([181, 302], true);

// On activation - play the release sequence once
indikL.loop = false;
indikL.playSegments([96, 396], true);
indikL.goToAndStop(0, true); // hard reset after completion
```

## The Responsive Benefit Of DOM Elements

Another major factor in our architectural decision was **responsive behavior**. Because we built _Stress Release_ in the DOM, we bypassed the complexities of scaling bounding boxes and collision vectors across different devices.

We handled responsive resizing entirely through **CSS variables**. By recalculating CSS custom properties on every resize, the layout simply reacts to the updated variables, and the Lottie SVGs scale naturally inside their containers without losing their state:

```
const appHeight = () => {
  const doc = document.documentElement;
  doc.style.setProperty("--doc-height", `${window.innerHeight}px`);
  doc.style.setProperty("--doc-width", `${doc.clientWidth}px`);
};
window.addEventListener("resize", appHeight);
appHeight(); // run immediately on init
```

## Mobile Performance Optimization: The Cost Of Lottie

While this architecture gave us total control over the art direction, it introduced a different challenge: **file size**.

Lottie JSON files can be heavy. We had 21 different character animations, plus multiple explosion variants that all needed to load. To ensure the experience remained fluid — especially on mobile devices — we implemented a few aggressive optimization strategies:

-   **Connection monitoring**  
    We tracked initial asset load time using `performance.now()` to detect slow connections and flag when load times exceeded 5 seconds.
-   **Sequential asset loading**  
    Rather than initialising all 21 character animations simultaneously, we load them in pairs using await, advancing only when each pair completes. This prevents a burst of simultaneous network requests and render work from blocking the browser on low-end devices.
-   **Aggressive memory management**  
    Instead of keeping our heavy explosion animations in memory, we destroy and recreate them on the fly. This trades a tiny instantiation cost for a much lower idle memory footprint.
-   **Dynamic quality reduction**  
    Quality reduction is a single API call applied immediately after each shelf character loads. The key is applying different quality levels depending on the character’s role in the scene:

```
// Shelf screen - 21 animations playing simultaneously
shelf = lottie.loadAnimation({
  container: document.getElementById("charShelf" + i),
  renderer: "svg",
  loop: true,
  autoplay: true,
  path: "assets/shelf/" + shelfFolders[i] + "/" + shelfFolders[i] + ".json",
});
lottie.setQuality(0.5); // 50% quality - reduces interpolation calculations
shelf.setSpeed(0.6);    // 60% speed - fewer frame calculations per second

// Play screen - single focused character
playChar = lottie.loadAnimation({
  container: document.getElementById("playChar"),
  renderer: "svg",
  loop: true,
  autoplay: true,
  path: chosenChar.url,
});
lottie.setQuality(1); // full quality - only one animation at a time
```

## Conclusion: Choosing The Right Tech For The Design

When determining the stack for a gamified web experience, it is critical to let the design requirements dictate the technology.

[![A stylized gameplay screen featuring a stretched animated character against a dramatic swirling background with scoring UI and interaction effects.](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/building-tactile-ux-honoring-intentional-design-lottie/05-conclusion.png)](https://files.smashing.media/articles/building-tactile-ux-honoring-intentional-design-lottie/05-conclusion.png)

The “Mega Squeeze” state combines layered animation sequences, background transitions, and timed interaction feedback to heighten the sense of impact. ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/building-tactile-ux-honoring-intentional-design-lottie/05-conclusion.png))

Because our interactions required bespoke, highly controlled visual reactions, we opted for **programmatic state control** over emergent simulation. This decision empowered the animators to dictate the exact feel of the experience, leaving the code to do what it does best: listen, calculate, and trigger.
