Healthcare websites often try to solve every question at once. They explain treatments, list services, describe procedures, introduce providers, answer insurance questions, and present multiple paths for different types of visitors. While the intention is good, the result is often the same: overwhelming pages filled with dense content, competing calls to action, and too many decisions.

**The question became simple**  
How do you design a healthcare website for people who don’t actually want to spend time reading healthcare websites?

This case study explores the thinking behind A Better Lou and how design, content structure, development decisions, and building within [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) helped create a simpler healthcare experience for its audience.

## Designing trust without medical tropes

Healthcare websites often rely on a familiar visual language. Blue interfaces. Clinical photography. Doctors in white coats. Medical illustrations. These patterns exist for a reason. They communicate trust quickly. The challenge with A Better Lou was that trust alone wasn’t enough. The brand focuses on helping men improve energy, strength, recovery, confidence, and long-term wellbeing. While healthcare expertise remains essential, the experience itself is ultimately about quality of life.

During the concept phase, we explored how trust could be communicated through clarity rather than medical symbolism. Instead of filling the interface with healthcare cues, we focused on typography, spacing, hierarchy, and imagery that felt approachable without sacrificing credibility. The result sits somewhere between healthcare, lifestyle, and editorial design. Professional enough to feel trustworthy, but human enough to feel relatable.

Rather than constantly reminding visitors that they are interacting with a medical service, the design focuses on where they want to go, not where they are today.

## Building around outcomes, not treatments

One observation shaped much of the site’s structure. Most healthcare websites are organized around treatments, procedures, and services. From a business perspective, this makes sense. From a visitor’s perspective, it often doesn’t. People rarely arrive searching for a treatment. They arrive with a problem: low energy, difficulty losing weight, slower recovery, or the effects of aging.

Our challenge was to connect those concerns with the solutions behind them. Throughout the website, we focused on outcomes first and clinical details second. This created a more intuitive path through the content and helped visitors quickly understand why a service might be relevant to them. The goal wasn’t to simplify healthcare. It was to simplify how people engage with it.

## Creating a foundation for growth

One challenge that often goes unnoticed in web design is scale. It’s relatively easy to create a few impressive pages. The real challenge begins when a website grows. New services are added, content expands, and entirely new sections need to be introduced. Ideas that work well on a small scale can quickly become difficult to maintain, both visually and technically.

For A Better Lou, we wanted to avoid building isolated moments that would eventually become limitations. Instead, we focused on establishing a clear set of rules that could support future growth without sacrificing the quality of the experience. This approach influenced both design and development. Layouts were built around repeatable patterns, content structures were designed to accommodate different types of information, and new pages could be introduced without requiring an entirely new visual language.

While highly customized solutions can create a strong first impression, long-term flexibility often provides greater value. A system that scales allows a website to evolve naturally over time while maintaining consistency, performance, and clarity. In many ways, the success of a website is determined not only by how it launches, but by how well it grows.

CMS Structure, components, and mobile template layouts

Working in Webflow reinforced this approach. Years of building websites on the platform have shown us that scalability is rarely solved after launch. Content structures, CMS relationships, reusable components, and page layouts all need to be considered from the beginning. By establishing these foundations early, the team can continue expanding the website without constantly redesigning or rebuilding existing parts of the experience.

## Designing for men without the clichés

Many brands in the men’s health space follow a predictable formula. Bold headlines. Aggressive messaging. Dark interfaces. Visual language built around performance, strength, and intensity. While these approaches can be effective, they often reduce a complex topic to a single idea: becoming more masculine.

A Better Lou felt different. The conversations around the brand were less about performance and more about quality of life. Energy. Recovery. Confidence. Longevity. The ability to feel better, move better, and stay engaged in the things that matter. This led us to a different visual direction. Rather than leaning into traditional men’s health aesthetics, we looked for a balance between healthcare, editorial design, and lifestyle. The website needed to feel trustworthy without becoming clinical, premium without feeling exclusive, and modern without chasing trends.

Selected moments from the experience

Typography became one of the primary tools for creating hierarchy and clarity. Large headlines and generous spacing allow visitors to quickly understand the purpose of each section without feeling overwhelmed. Photography focuses on real people and everyday moments rather than exaggerated transformations or fitness-driven imagery. The visual system relies on restraint, allowing content and messaging to carry more of the conversation. The result sits somewhere between a healthcare website and an editorial publication. Familiar enough to build trust, but distinct enough to avoid the clichés often associated with men’s health marketing.

## Bringing the experience to life

The entire website was built in Webflow. When structuring a project, we always start by establishing the core system first. This can be done through existing class frameworks and libraries that provide predefined guidelines, or entirely from scratch if you’re confident in the consistency of your own approach. For us, the process always begins with typography, buttons, links, wrappers, spacing rules, and other reusable components. These foundational elements create a predictable system that makes future development significantly easier.

Much of the website’s dynamic content is managed through [Webflow CMS](https://webflow.com/feature/cms). Content can be imported directly from CSV files, making it possible to populate large datasets without manually creating individual entries. When combined with automated workflows and integrations, updating content can become as simple as managing a spreadsheet, allowing both the client and the team to maintain the website efficiently as it continues to grow.

All motion and interactions were built using GSAP. One of the biggest advantages of the Webflow integration is that there is no need to write GSAP code manually. The native integration allows animations to be created visually, much like setting keyframes in After Effects. Another benefit is maintenance. GSAP is automatically loaded through Webflow, ensuring access to the latest version of the library without the need for manual updates or additional configuration. This makes it easier to build sophisticated interactions while keeping the workflow accessible to both designers and developers.

For video content, we used a custom Vimeo integration. Most teams embed Vimeo or YouTube videos directly using embed codes. While this works, it often creates unnecessary complexity for clients. Someone needs to locate the correct embed code, update it manually, and ensure nothing breaks in the process. Instead, we built the integration around Vimeo IDs and hash parameters. Navigation and player controls are disabled, while two custom buttons handle video playback and audio activation.

On hover, we display the same video as a silent preview. This creates a more seamless browsing experience while keeping page loads lightweight and responsive.

Most importantly, the workflow remains simple for the client. Updating a video only requires changing the Vimeo ID and hash values within the CMS. Once those fields are updated, the new video is automatically available without touching any code or rebuilding components.

## Building for the long term

One lesson from A Better Lou reinforced something we’ve experienced across many projects. Creating a few impressive pages is rarely the difficult part. The real challenge is building something that remains useful as content grows, services change, and teams continue working with it long after launch.

Design, development, content structure, CMS architecture, video workflows, and interactions all contribute to that outcome. The best systems are often the ones that quietly support growth without forcing teams to rethink everything six months later. For A Better Lou, the goal was never to create complexity behind simplicity. It was to create a foundation that allows both to coexist.
