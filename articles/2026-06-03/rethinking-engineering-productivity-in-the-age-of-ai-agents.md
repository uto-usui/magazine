_This blog covers topics presented at the_ [_DX Annual 2026_](https://dxannual.com/) _developer productivity conference._

For years, engineering productivity has focused on reducing friction inside the software development lifecycle, with AI coding tools intended to accelerate implementation work and developer output. But as those tools became [widely adopted across engineering](https://dropbox.tech/culture/ai-adoption-productivity-dropbox-cto-ali-dasdan) at Dropbox, we realized that accelerating code generation simply shifted some bottlenecks downstream.

AI has dramatically increased coding throughput, but the faster code moves, the more pressure it puts on review queues, CI systems, validation workflows, release coordination, and production operations. The challenge is no longer simply helping engineers write code faster, but enabling the broader software development lifecycle to absorb, validate, and safely ship a much larger volume of work. That realization pushed Dropbox beyond AI tool adoption and toward a [broader evolution of our engineering systems](https://dropbox.tech/machine-learning/introducing-nova-our-internal-platform-for-coding-agents) and workflows.

In this post, we’ll share how Dropbox is moving from AI tools that assist engineers to agentic systems that can execute scoped tasks, how we’re building platforms to support those workflows, and how engineers are adapting to work alongside them.

## From copilots to agents

The first wave of AI coding tools accelerated implementation work inside existing developer workflows by helping explain code, generate snippets, and answer questions. These tools were highly effective, but they largely operated as copilots alongside the engineer.

The introduction of agents changed this interaction model. An agent can take a scoped task, inspect the codebase, edit files, run tests, iterate on failures, and return an artifact for human review. Engineers remain accountable for intent, architecture, quality, and release decisions, but the implementation workflow starts to look very different. With agentic development, engineers can initiate more parallel work, explore more options, and offload repetitive execution that previously consumed significant time and attention.

But as agents accelerated code output, the surrounding systems responsible for reviewing, validating, and shipping that work came under increasing strain. Review systems, testing infrastructure, validation workflows, release processes, and production operations all needed to adapt to a much larger volume of AI-assisted output.

That shift also forced us to rethink the broader engineering environment around these tools. More code and more pull requests do not automatically translate into greater customer value. And because agentic engineering changes how engineers plan, review, validate, and own work, enablement became just as important as the tooling itself.

## Nova as our agent platform

One of the best examples of this shift is Nova, [our internal coding agent platform](https://dropbox.tech/machine-learning/introducing-nova-our-internal-platform-for-coding-agents). We built Nova to allow engineers to describe a task in plain language and run an AI coding agent in a controlled environment with the context needed to work against our codebase. Nova’s value comes less from the model itself than the systems surrounding it: codebase context, internal engineering practices, safe execution, workflow integration, and human review.

Nova is already producing meaningful output, accounting for roughly 1 in 12 pull requests at Dropbox today, with adoption continuing to grow. But the more important shift is how it changes the operating model itself. Work that previously required a sequence of manual steps can become a structured, reviewable workflow: define the task, allow the agent to execute within established guardrails, validate the result, and have a human make the final judgment before any code reaches production.

Nova also extends beyond feature development. It is increasingly used for migrations, flaky test remediation, bug investigation, dependency updates, and other forms of high-toil engineering work that are critical to maintaining healthy systems but often difficult to prioritize. We’re continuing to develop new systems that’ll enable more agentic workstreams.

## Measuring product velocity, not just code output

As AI-assisted output increases, we‘re also rethinking how we measure engineering productivity. When coding velocity was the primary constraint, pull request throughput was a useful productivity signal. But once AI changed the shape and volume of that work, it became clear that throughput alone was no longer sufficient.

As PR volume rises, the challenge is no longer simply measuring output but understanding whether the broader system absorbs that increase efficiently. Review burden, CI costs, rework, and software quality all become important signals, alongside whether the additional output ultimately translates into greater customer value. That shift led us toward a broader measurement model that treats engineering productivity as a progression from AI usage to workflow adoption, production output, and ultimately customer impact.

The measurement model is organized in 4 stages. “Fuel” measures whether AI tools are being exercised. “Adoption” tracks how workflows are changing across teams. “Output” measures whether AI contributes to production work. And “Impact” focuses on the outcome that matters most: improving product velocity and reducing the time it takes to move from idea to customer value.

Quality and trust matter as much as speed. We track signals such as code review turnaround time, first-run test pass rate, defect ratio, and rework rate to understand whether increased output is holding up under real-world conditions. Faster code generation cannot come at the expense of reliability or customer trust. That is the core measurement shift: moving from local activity metrics toward broader system outcomes.

## Engineering workflows have to evolve too

Importantly, agentic engineering is not just a tooling shift. It changes the operating model of software development itself. As agents take on more implementation work, the role of the engineer increasingly shifts toward defining intent, mapping problems, reviewing generated changes, and making higher-context architectural and quality decisions. Engineers still own outcomes, but the [shape of day-to-day work](https://dropbox.tech/culture/insights-from-our-executive-roundtable-on-ai-and-engineering-productivity) starts to look very different.

That transition does not happen automatically. Successfully adopting agentic workflows requires enablement alongside tooling. At Dropbox, we have invested in hands-on learning, [hackathons](https://dropbox.tech/culture/hack-week-2025-liquid-cooling-gpu-server), workflow spotlights, bootcamps, and peer-led examples to help teams learn from engineers already working this way.

Different teams also adopt these workflows at different speeds. Some engineers want more flexibility and automation immediately, while others need clearer guardrails, trust signals, and examples tied to their actual work. Teams working in higher-risk systems often require a more deliberate path than teams operating in lower-risk or more isolated parts of the codebase. The goal is not to force every workflow through an agent. It is to make agentic development useful, safe, measurable, and repeatable where it creates meaningful leverage.

## What we learned

The biggest lesson in this shift is that AI doesn’t eliminate bottlenecks in software development, but it does move them. As code generation accelerates, the constraints shift downstream into review, validation, testing, release coordination, and production operations. Optimizing the old bottleneck no longer creates the same level of leverage.

That changes where organizations need to invest. Generation alone is not enough. Validation, orchestration, workflow integration, governance, and measurement become increasingly important as agentic systems scale. The advantage will not come from access to the same foundation models everyone else can use. It will come from the systems built around those models: context, internal tooling, quality controls, and the workflows that connect them together.

Agentic engineering also moves more pressure upstream into product and design as well. As implementation becomes faster and more parallel, the quality of product judgment, design clarity, and structured specifications matters even more. Investing in sharper problem framing, better specs, faster design validation, and tighter product-engineering collaboration becomes an essential component of agentic engineering.

We’ve also learned that traditional productivity metrics no longer tell the full story. Pull request throughput still matters, but the more important question is whether AI helps teams move ideas to customers faster without eroding reliability, quality, or trust. Agentic engineering is about allowing engineers to shift more of their attention and judgment to where it matters most: defining intent, designing durable systems, validating quality, and delivering customer value faster.

The future of engineering productivity will not be defined solely by who has the best models. It will be defined by who builds the best systems around them. The real challenge is no longer just generating more code, but building engineering systems that can reliably turn AI-assisted output into valuable experiences for our customers.
