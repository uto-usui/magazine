## An outline version of the new CSS logo

[CSS & HTML](https://kilianvalkhof.com/category/css-html/), 20 November 2024, 2 minute read

CSS got a new logo! After well over a decade of using the “CSS3” badge, there’s now a new CSS logo that fits nicely next to the JS, TS and friends logo’s.

CSS Logo A purple square with rounded corners and the letters CSS inside in white

And here it is among friends:

Looks pretty good right?

### Outline version [#](#outline-version)

I can’t wait to see this replace the “CSS3” badge across the web and wanted to update the icon for the [Live CSS panel in Polypane](https://polypane.app/docs/live-css/) too.

All the icons in Polypane are from the [Tabler icons](https://tabler-icons.io/) icon set which are all in “outline style” on a 24 by 24px grid, so last Friday I spent a few hours creating a 24 by 24 pixel outline version of the logo, shown here at 24px, 48px, 128px and 256px.

The official repo [isn’t accepting variants](https://github.com/CSS-Next/logo.css/issues/38) but I’ve proposed it for inclusion in Tabler icons here: [CSS icon #1266](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons/issues/1266) so if you’d like to see it added make sure to leave a comment or Emoji response there.

### Grab it here [#](#grab-it-here)

While it hopefully will be added to an icon set soon, you can also just grab the icon from this page, for example by [right-clicking them in Polypane](https://polypane.app/blog/polypane-20-1-the-accessibility-tree/#copy-svg-from-context-menu) and selecting “Copy SVG as code”.
