Abstract for my session [Talkin’ Tables](https://conf.a11yto.com/playlist#day-2), which I presented in place of another speaker who had to back out the day before:

> This session will walk through the basics of how to construct an HTML table. More than basic structure, it will talk about support and how it is exposed to screen readers in particular. With that foundation it will walk through patterns for responsive tables, fixed column and/or row headers, sortable tables, tables with expandable content, labeling controls in a table, and selecting rows. Each of these will take into account WCAG conformance, actual support, and the necessary HTML, ARIA, CSS, and JavaScript to pull it off. Even if you cannot apply these to your table patterns, they should give you insights into how to consider the code in your own tables. We probably won’t talk about grid roles. At least not much.

Ideally you’re here because you followed the link in the slides. Otherwise this post might not make a lot of sense.

I have embedded a [3.3MB tagged PDF of the slides](https://adrianroselli.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Talkin-Tables_A11yTO.pdf). The export from PowerPoint is not great. The videos are not retained. The PDF tags are verbose and complex. It does not pass PDF/UA. But I wanted to have it for the talk the next day. Reader beware.

The following informed the talk either directly or because of a related concept. Probably ignore some of the older ones. They don’t get many updates and may be based on old technologies or techniques (or both).
