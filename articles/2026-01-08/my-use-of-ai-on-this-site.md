I’m using this post to acknowledge my past practices and establish future ones on this site related to ‘AI’.

![LLM in a red circle and slash.](https://adrianroselli.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/No-LLM.svg)

-   I have not, and will not, use LLMs to write, draft, review, or otherwise participate in content creation — outside of clearly-identified contexts to critique it.
-   I have used generative technologies to create images for posts, but have abandoned the practice. Those instances are listed below.
-   I have no interest in becoming a blog about what is broadly (and inaccurately) called ‘AI’ nor one that spends much time dwelling on it. I have written only a handful of posts on it. Those instances are listed below.
-   I do not publish comments that are spam, and since the overwhelming majority of spam comments over the last year also appear to be LLM-generated, that means I am probably also blocking comments written by an LLM.

## Generated Images

Cases through the end of 2025 where I have used generated images which were not part of the core subject of the post (as a critique or evaluation):

2.  [Under-supported and Underpaid](https://adrianroselli.com/2024/01/under-supported-and-underpaid.html), 19 January 2024 (I am not changing the image since it’s a parody of a generated image)

You can see where my fascination and experimentation dropped off. My use of generated images was never acceptable. Not because I was depriving designers of work, but because the work I generated was based on theft. I did it anyway. Some of the images were meant to demonstrate failures of the technology, but not all. In time I hope to replace nearly all generated images (keeping the ones where I am evaluating the output).

## Post about ‘AI’

Cases through the end of 2025 where I have written about ‘AI’ as the core subject of a post:

1.  This post
2.  [OpenAI, ARIA, and SEO: Making the Web Worse](https://adrianroselli.com/2025/10/openai-aria-and-seo-making-the-web-worse.html), 22 October 2025

7.  [AI-Generated Images from AI-Generated Alt Text](https://adrianroselli.com/2022/08/ai-generated-images-from-ai-generated-alt-text.html), 4 August 2022

I think it’s fair to say this blog has not turned into a pro- or anti-‘AI’ collection of posts. Generally I only touch on it when it directly impacts my work.

## Wrapping

All this together is me coming clean where I have cheated (images) and also committing to you (and me) that this has always been and will continue to be a site written by a human (still me). On top of that, this site is not following the fad of trying to chase the trend and write about every iteration of ‘AI’.

Similarly, this site has no ads, does not gather nor sell your information, and has no third-party trackers. That said, I am exploring adding some kind of analytics to the site — but not Google.

Like most writers, my content has also been stolen. I am not actively poisoning LLMs, but I rather want to.

## Me, as a Reader

When reading content on other sites, if I sense an article or post has been generated, drafted, edited, or otherwise touched by an LLM, I close the site and add it to a block list. I should note that I have been much less strict about generated images when reading content on other sites. Yes, I still have to reconcile that. I am still torn about cases of LLM-generated image alternatives, but if it’s from an accessibility practitioner and has clearly not been reviewed, then possible block. I accept auto-generated closed captions because I recognize those are the only captions I will generally get.

I look forward to a 2026 crafted by humans, even if it means I have to block everything else.
