It’s been a little while since I’ve played around with making creative stuff with CSS just for fun. My trip to [State of the Browser](https://hidde.blog/sotb-2024/) conference at the weekend reminded me why I love the web and the creative community around it. If you haven’t already, you should check out [Hidde’s summary](https://hidde.blog/) of the conference. Every talk was absolutely top quality (and some were downright jaw-dropping — Katie Fenn’s live Daft Punk performance in particular!).

Sophie has written a lovely post on [why you should go to conferences](https://localghost.dev/blog/you-should-go-to-conferences/), and I couldn’t agree more. She includes a list of great web conferences to suit any budget. Attending and speaking at conferences has been 100% worth it for me!

Now, on with the creative stuff. I often find myself thinking of creative ideas (for drawing, painting, writing — anything!) but find myself with a complete lack of time to execute them. So being able to create something super quick is highly appealing, and often serves as a catalyst for sparking new ideas and spending time on something bigger. No, I’m not talking about generative AI! Part of the reason I love the web is that, for me, it’s a medium that allows me space to experiment and make stuff quickly, and the result can easily be refactored, redesigned or thrown away if I don’t like it.

One thing I quite enjoy at home is making small collages with scrap paper — just gluing a few random shapes in a pleasing way to create different patterns and compositions. I enjoy being limited by whatever I happen to have to hand, and seeing whether I can make something that looks nice. I had the idea of redesigning my personal site, using compositions of simple geometric shapes as a motif (who knows whether I’ll get around to doing this!). As a bit of a brainstorm, and to scratch the creative itch, I came up with the idea of creating a simple composition using three CSS gradients, then remixing them with custom properties to see what different outcomes I could generate while keeping the same feel.

To prevent myself getting carried away and spending hours tweaking things, I decided to limit myself in a similar way to having just a few scraps of paper to play with. Each composition has the same base colour background, and same three background gradients that can be adjusted in a limited way with custom properties. The colours can’t be varied, only a few details like the size and position of the circle (made with a radial gradient), or the angle and width of the linear gradient. No additional elements or pseudo-elements are allowed.

Here’s the result!

See the Pen [Gradient background composition exercise](https://codepen.io/michellebarker/pen/PorvQXz) by Michelle Barker ([@michellebarker](https://codepen.io/michellebarker)) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).

This was a really fun exercise in composition and creativity within narrow limits. I’m definitely going to try out some more ideas.
