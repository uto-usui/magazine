## Quickly find the Gravatar that cor­res­ponds to a given email

After a bit of googling and wandering around in [Gravatar’s official site](http://gravatar.com/) and others, I firgured out it’s probably much quicker to write a short PHP script for that myself, than keep looking.

Here it is, in case someone ever needs to do something similar: (click on the screenshot)
