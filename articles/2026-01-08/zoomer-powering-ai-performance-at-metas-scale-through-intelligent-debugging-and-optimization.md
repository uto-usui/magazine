-   We’re introducing Zoomer, Meta’s comprehensive, automated debugging and optimization platform for AI. 
-   Zoomer works across all of our training and inference workloads at Meta and provides deep performance insights that enable energy savings, workflow acceleration, and efficiency gains in our AI infrastructure. 
-   Zoomer has delivered training time reductions, and significant QPS improvements, making it the de-facto tool for AI performance optimization across Meta’s entire AI infrastructure.

At the scale that Meta’s AI infrastructure operates, poor performance debugging can lead to massive energy inefficiency, increased operational costs, and suboptimal hardware utilization across hundreds of thousands of GPUs. The fundamental challenge is achieving maximum computational efficiency while minimizing waste. Every percentage point of utilization improvement translates to significant capacity gains that can be redirected to innovation and growth.

Zoomer is Meta’s automated, one-stop-shop platform for performance profiling, debugging, analysis, and optimization of AI training and inference workloads. Since its inception, Zoomer has become the de-facto tool across Meta for GPU workload optimization, generating tens of thousands of profiling reports daily for teams across all of our apps. 

## Why Debugging Performance Matters

[Our AI infrastructure](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/09/29/data-infrastructure/metas-infrastructure-evolution-and-the-advent-of-ai/) supports [large-scale and advanced workloads across a global fleet of GPU clusters, continually evolving to meet the growing scale and complexity of generative AI](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/06/12/production-engineering/maintaining-large-scale-ai-capacity-meta/).

At the training level it supports a diverse range of workloads, including powering models for [ads ranking](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/11/10/ml-applications/metas-generative-ads-model-gem-the-central-brain-accelerating-ads-recommendation-ai-innovation/), [content recommendations](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/05/21/production-engineering/journey-to-1000-models-scaling-instagrams-recommendation-system/), and [GenAI features](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/05/20/web/metas-full-stack-hhvm-optimizations-for-genai/).  

At the inference level, we serve hundreds of trillions of AI model executions per day.

Operating at this scale means putting a high priority on eliminating GPU underutilization. Training inefficiencies delay model iterations and product launches, while inference bottlenecks limit our ability to serve user requests at scale. Removing resource waste and accelerating workflows helps us train larger models more efficiently, serve more users, and reduce our environmental footprint.

Zoomer is an automated debugging and optimization platform that works across all of our AI model types (ads recommendations, GenAI, computer vision, etc.) and both training and inference paradigms, providing deep performance insights that enable energy savings, workflow acceleration, and efficiency gains.  

Zoomer’s architecture consists of three essential layers that work together to deliver comprehensive AI performance insights: 

### Infrastructure and Platform Layer

The foundation provides the enterprise-grade scalability and reliability needed to profile workloads across Meta’s massive infrastructure. This includes distributed storage systems using [Manifold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tddb-zbmnTo) (Meta’s blob storage platform) for trace data, fault-tolerant processing pipelines that handle huge trace files, and low-latency data collection with automatic profiling triggers across thousands of hosts simultaneously. The platform maintains high availability and scale through redundant processing workers and can handle huge numbers of profiling requests during peak usage periods.

### Analytics and Insights Engine

The core intelligence layer delivers deep analytical capabilities through multiple specialized analyzers. This includes: GPU trace analysis via Kineto integration and NVIDIA DCGM, CPU profiling through [StrobeLight](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/01/21/production-engineering/strobelight-a-profiling-service-built-on-open-source-technology/) integration, host-level metrics analysis via [dyno telemetry](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2022/11/16/dynolog-open-source-system-observability/), communication pattern analysis for distributed training, straggler detection across distributed ranks, memory allocation profiling (including GPU memory snooping), request/response profiling for inference workloads, and much more. The engine automatically detects performance anti-patterns and also provides actionable recommendations.

### Visualization and User Interface Layer

The presentation layer transforms complex performance data into intuitive, actionable insights. This includes interactive timeline visualizations showing GPU activity across thousands of ranks, multi-iteration analysis for long-running training workloads, drill-down dashboards with percentile analysis across devices, trace data visualization integrated with Perfetto for kernel-level inspection, heat map visualizations for identifying outliers across GPU deployments, and automated insight summaries that highlight critical bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

## How Zoomer Profiling Works: From Trigger to Insights

Understanding how Zoomer conducts a complete performance analysis provides insight into its sophisticated approach to AI workload optimization.

### Profiling Trigger Mechanisms

Zoomer operates through both automatic and on-demand profiling strategies tailored to different workload types. For training workloads, which involve multiple iterations and can run for days or weeks, Zoomer automatically triggers profiling around iteration 550-555 to capture stable-state performance while avoiding startup noise. For inference workloads, profiling can be triggered on-demand for immediate debugging or through integration with automated load testing and benchmarking systems for continuous monitoring.

### Comprehensive Data Capture

During each profiling session, Zoomer simultaneously collects multiple data streams to build a holistic performance picture:
