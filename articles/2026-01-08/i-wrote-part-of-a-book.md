You’ve probably already seen the tweets and the blog posts about—and hopefully already bought and read—the new [Smashing Book](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-book-4-new-perspectives/), but I’m really pleased about it, so I want to add my own to the list.

Earlier this year I was contacted by Vitaly and asked if I’d like to contribute a chapter to Smashing Magazine’s latest book, The Smashing Book 4: New Perspectives On Web Design. I’d never been in print before (not properly, anyway), so I leapt at the chance.

My chapter, somewhat unsurprisingly, covers CSS and front-end architecture, and new, pragmatic, and modern approaches to writing and scaling CSS for today’s Web. It’s the first chapter in a book crammed with stellar insights from people far cleverer than I. I feel honoured to be a part of it.

It’s a big ol’ book—just shy of 500 pages—full of practical insights from some really, really great authors, and—at less than $50—is a total bargain!
