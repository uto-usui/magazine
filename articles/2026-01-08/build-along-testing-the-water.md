**N.B.** The build along [went ahead](https://csswizardry.com/2011/11/build-along-1-reflection-and-reasoning/).

I’ve been toying around with this idea the last few weeks. I’ve decided to do a quick _testing-the-water_ blog post to gauge interest and see whether anyone else would be into the idea. The story goes thus…

A few weeks ago I was building a page for my good friend and awesome chap [Nick Payne](https://twitter.com/makeusabrew)–the page had been designed by another swell fella, [Ian Thomas](https://twitter.com/anatomic). We’re all pretty good friends and all excel in different areas, Ian designed Nick’s site and, [as designers _don’t_ need to code](https://csswizardry.com/2011/09/do-designers-need-to-code/), I built it. Nick sorted all the back-end and is building it onto [JAOSS](http://jaoss.org/).

**N.B.** Ian can and does actually code, but for this project we all wanted a slice of the action so, in this case, he didn’t…

Anyway, I always build static HTML files in my [Dropbox](http://db.tt/9mQuY9k) _public_ directory as people can have a quick look at it if I need to share it, plus I can test it on a variety of browsers on different devices. I gave Nick the URL early on and told him I was about to get to work…

An hour or so later I got a text from Nick saying that he was loving seeing the progress with every refresh, which I also thought was pretty cool.

Enter my idea… a live build-along!

The idea I’m toying with is that people (it could be pretty much anyone) get in touch (somehow) with PSDs they need building; a PSD that they were going to get their staff in their agency to do, or that they were going to give out to a freelancer, anything, and I will pick one and build it for free on the provision I can build it in my public directory and that people can watch along as I code away.

There are obviously some massive requirements:

-   People would actually want to watch me code a page up; I feel I may be being terribly big-headed in assuming people might actually want to watch me code.
-   The PSD is all above board, doesn’t break any NDAs etc.
-   Whoever gets ‘picked’ doesn’t mind their work being made wholly public from the outset.

The outcomes would be:

-   Someone gets a free template (one page) built.
-   People who wouldn’t die of boredom get to follow along as I build a page (I seriously think the idea of seeing how someone tackles a build would be really cool, it’d be like watching TV and yelling along: ‘Clear your floats!!!’)

So basically:

-   People submit PSDs.
-   I choose one.
-   I pick an evening to build it.
-   I share the URL on Twitter and in a blog post.
-   People can keep the tab open and keep dipping in-and-out as I build, watching the progress.
-   For people not in the right time-zone I could potentially record the screen.
-   I finish and hand back a fully coded single-page.

Naturally there would be some informal terms and conditions that I’d iron out nearer the time but for now, anyone interested?

Lemme know!
