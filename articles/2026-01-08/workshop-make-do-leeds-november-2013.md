I shall be giving my first workshop in association with the great guys at [Make Do](http://makedo.in/) in my hometown, Leeds, on 29 November, 2013. The workshop, [Planning and building a big front-end](http://makedo.in/leeds/css-workshop/), is a full-day event held in the centre of the city, where attendees will learn about optimal CSS architecture, naming conventions, scalability, pragmatism, tying things all together with Sass, and a lot, _lot_ more.

This event is incredibly good value, at only £225 per ticket (£200 for early bird), and the Make Do guys are sure to plan a great after-party as well! [See you there?](http://makedo.in/leeds/css-workshop/)
