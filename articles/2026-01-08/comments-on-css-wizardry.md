Hi guys, long time no speak. I’ve been absolutely rushed off my feet of late with 101 other things. CSS Wizardry – although it hasn’t been updated in far too long – has had a massive surge of comment spam. Massive :(

I can’t pick through 6,000+ comments looking for the odd real one so I’m gonna blitz them all and if you have left a comment which hasn’t made it live just let me know and I’ll reinstate it.

Cheers, and sorry,  
_H_
