I’m absolutely thrilled, humbled and delighted to announce that I’ve been nominated for [.net’s Young Developer of the Year award, 2013!](http://www.thenetawards.com/)

I do feel a bit of a fraud in that I’ve been doing this internet thing for ages now – and because [most people think I’m around 27](https://twitter.com/csswizardry/status/277793781300994049) – but sure enough, enough people (you guys!) put my name forward for the category that I’m into the official 12! I’m up against some _real_ talent as well, which I think says a lot about the quality of the industry’s young devs.

The next stage is the public (you guys again!) vote. You can cast votes for who _you_ believe deserves to make the final three; the final three then go onto a judged decision ‘behind closed doors’.

This post is, predictably, me trying to garner support from you lot. If you…

-   …have ever read and enjoyed any of my posts here on CSS Wizardry
-   …used any of my open source stuff in your work
-   …received any advice or help from me via email or on Twitter
-   …enjoyed and/or learned anything from any of my talks
-   …benefitted in _any_ way, shape, or form from anything I’ve done in the web development world

…then I would be _super_ grateful for any support. You can cast your vote at [thenetawards.com](http://www.thenetawards.com/)

Thanks so much!
