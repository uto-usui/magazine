I’ve just put a new project live–[inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com/). inuit.css is a sensible, production-ready and actually useful CSS framework. It doesn’t do much styling, but does a lot of nifty, functional things that most people should find useful.

The framework aims to tackle real problems and remove the boring, repetitive jobs that development sometimes brings. Follow [@inuitcss](https://twitter.com/inuitcss) for update info and release news, as well as being able to suggest new features and report bugs.

Massive thanks to [Bryan James](http://www.bryanjamesdesign.co.uk/) for the amazing logo and illustration work. [Follow him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/WengersToyBus)–he’s one of the best designers I’ve _ever_ met.
