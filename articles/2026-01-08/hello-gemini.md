Gemini! Excited to share I’m now a director focused on AI in Google Cloud

**After nearly 14 years [building developer experiences in Chrome](https://addyosmani.com/blog/farewell-chrome), I’m thrilled to begin a new chapter focused entirely on what’s increasingly become my next big arc: helping developers and businesses succeed with Gemini.**

Over the past few years, an increasing portion of my work has been on the [Gemini side of Google](https://addyosmani.com/blog/gemini-3/) (across Gemini model, tool launches and more). Each launch reinforced what I already knew: we’re at an inflection point where AI fundamentally changes how we build, ship, and scale software. The opportunity to focus full-time on this transformation - specifically in the enterprise context where the stakes and impact are highest - was impossible to pass up.

I’m joining Google Cloud AI as a director focused on helping developers and businesses succeed with [Gemini](https://gemini.addy.ie/), Vertex AI, Agent Development Kit (ADK), Gemini Enterprise, and the broader enterprise AI platform. I’ll be bridging Google DeepMind, engineering, product, go-to-market, and developer relations teams with one clear goal: helping you get the most value out of Gemini.

What I’ll be working on:

Cloud AI is where Gemini meets real business and enterprise needs at scale. My focus will be on showing developers and technical leaders how to build with Gemini, Vertex AI, and ADK, connecting engineering reality with product vision, go-to-market strategy, and developer community needs. I want to make sure the tools, docs, APIs, and patterns exist for builders to ship confidently with Gemini.

This role sits at the intersection of everything I care about: developer experience, technical depth, community building, and practical impact.

I’m energized by what’s ahead: an enterprise AI platform that’s still in its early chapters, a team committed to getting it right, and a community of builders ready to push the boundaries of what’s possible.

If you’re building with Gemini, exploring Vertex AI, or thinking about how AI transforms your business - I’d love to connect. Let’s build the future together.
