**2025 was one remarkable year for Codrops.**

It exceeded all our expectations and became our most active and impactful year yet, driven by the sheer amount of work published and the incredible energy, curiosity, and generosity of the creative community. We shared more articles than ever before, and from experimental demos to deep technical dives, the volume and quality of work on Codrops throughout the year has been nothing short of mind-blowing.

At the heart of it all was a clear vision: to empower creatives and put their work in the spotlight. This vision guided everything we did. We expanded our editorial formats with features like the Developer and Designer Spotlights, and most recently introduced the Studio/Agency Spotlight, giving unique creatives and teams a space to share their world, their process, and the thinking behind their craft. Seeing how these stories were received by the community has been one of the most rewarding parts of the year.

The numbers tell part of the story, too. **In 2025, over 200 articles were published.** We now have more than **2,200 websites** in our [Webzibition](https://tympanus.net/codrops/webzibition/). We also launched the [Creative Hub](https://tympanus.net/codrops/hub/), which now hosts **1,000+ open source demos**, becoming a growing home for learning, experimentation, and inspiration.

None of this would have been possible without the incredible support of our partners. We were lucky to collaborate with amazing brands like GSAP/Webflow, Penpot, Rive, Spline, Shopify, Readymag, Droip, Storybook, Wix, and many more. They truly understand the value of this community and help sustain it through their generous support. This is something we are incredibly grateful for.

Above all, our deepest thanks go to the contributors who truly shape Codrops: the creators, collaborators, and tutorial writers who so generously share their ideas, experiments, and knowledge. Your curiosity drives innovation, your openness fuels learning, and your willingness to document and explain your process turns complex ideas into accessible inspiration for thousands of creatives around the world. Every demo, article, and tutorial represents a meaningful investment of time and expertise, and it is this collective spirit of sharing that keeps Codrops vibrant, relevant, and forward-looking. **We are endlessly grateful for your trust, your passion, and your commitment to helping this community grow.**

So yes, 2025 turned out to be an incredible year. And as we look ahead, we do so energized, thankful, and more excited than ever about what’s next for Codrops and the creative community that makes it all possible.

**With that in mind, let’s take a look at what we’ve been up to. The sections below highlight the work, ideas, and experiments that defined Codrops in 2025.**

## Creative Hub

For a long time, our demos lived across different places, while the Collective newsletter became a way to highlight inspiring experiments by other creators from around the web. When we decided to sunset the Collective, it felt natural to bring everything together in one dedicated space. That idea became the [Creative Hub](https://tympanus.net/codrops/hub/).

The Creative Hub is a curated home for demos, both those created for Codrops tutorials and open source experiments shared by the wider community. We regularly add new work, carefully selected for its creativity, craftsmanship, and technical depth. With more than 1,000 demos and counting, the Hub has become a living collection for exploration, learning, and inspiration.

Explore the Creative Hub by browsing demos across a wide range of topics, from [3D](https://tympanus.net/codrops/hub/tag/3d/), [WebGL](https://tympanus.net/codrops/hub/tag/webgl/), [Three.js](https://tympanus.net/codrops/hub/tag/three-js/), and [React Three Fiber](https://tympanus.net/codrops/hub/tag/react-three-fiber/) to [particle systems](https://tympanus.net/codrops/hub/tag/particles/), [scroll-driven interactions](https://tympanus.net/codrops/hub/tag/scroll/), [infinite layouts](https://tympanus.net/codrops/hub/tag/infinite/), [carousels](https://tympanus.net/codrops/hub/tag/carousel/), [typography](https://tympanus.net/codrops/hub/tag/typography/), [UI experiments](https://tympanus.net/codrops/hub/tag/ui/), and animation-focused demos using [GSAP](https://tympanus.net/codrops/hub/tag/gsap/).

**We’ve also compiled a special selection of interesting demos from the past year: check out the [2025 Demo Highlights](https://tympanus.net/codrops/hub/2025-demo-highlights/).**

## Learning with Tutorials

Learning has always been at the core of Codrops, and in 2025 it played a bigger role than ever. Over the course of the year, we published [51 tutorials](https://tympanus.net/codrops/category/tutorials/), covering a wide range of techniques and ideas for creative development.

Animation was a clear focus, with GSAP standing out as a key tool for powering expressive motion, smooth interactions, and rich, dynamic experiences across many of these tutorials.

**A big thank you to the tutorial writers who shared their animation knowledge in these motion-focused tutorials: [David Faure](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/davidfaure/), [Joffrey Spitzer](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/joffreyspitzer/), [Andrea Biason](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/andreabiason/), [Carl Schooff](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/carl_schooff/), [Filip Zrnzevic](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/filip/), [Gwen Bogaert](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/gwenbogaert/), [Jorge Toloza](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/jorgetloza/), [Joseph Santamaria](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/joseph/), [Osmo](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/ilja/), [Ross Anderson](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/rossanderson/) and [Tom Miller](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/creativeocean/).**

Building Responsive, Scroll-Triggered Curved Path Animations with GSAP

Beyond animation-focused tutorials, we covered a wide range of topics that reflect how creative development continues to evolve. A dominant theme throughout the year was 3D and WebGL, with many tutorials centered around Three.js, React Three Fiber, and related workflows. These articles explored everything from shaders, post-processing, and procedural effects to scene optimization, performance considerations, and practical R3F patterns, offering hands-on guidance for building rich, interactive 3D experiences on the web.

We also published tutorials focused on UI interactions and layout systems, covering techniques such as scroll-based interactions, grids, carousels, draggable elements, cursors, typography experiments, infinite layouts, and marquees. These pieces bridged visual design and implementation, showing how motion and interaction can shape the overall feel and usability of an interface.

A number of tutorials looked at tools like Rive and Framer Motion, focusing on smarter animation systems, data-driven motion, and real-world integration workflows. Alongside this, we shared practical guidance around design and site-building workflows, with tutorials touching on tools like Webflow, WordPress, and Figma, and how they connect with modern front-end techniques.

Finally, we explored emerging topics such as AI, including tutorials on AI agents and AI-assisted development, showing how these tools can support performance monitoring, physics systems, and more experimental workflows.

## Creative Experiments

We’ve also shared and highlighted some great playground experiments this year — explorations in interaction, motion, and visual craft, just for the joy of trying things out. And it was especially exciting to see Niccolò Fanton’s real-time dithering shader really take off and get shared widely.

Huge thanks to [deadrabbbbit](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/deadrabbbbit/), [Niccolò Fanton](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/niccolofanton/), [Ikram Hakim](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/IkramHakim/), and [Serhii Polyvanyi](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/panpolevan/) for contributing!

## Special Features

We’re incredibly proud to have had such brilliant minds share their work with us this year — generous deep dives, honest reflections, and the kind of experiments that remind us why this community is so special.

[Hector Arellano](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/hector/) and [matsuoka-601](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/matsuoka_601/) took us straight into the cutting edge, showing what’s now possible with WebGPU: from the long, hard-won journey of building fluid simulations on the web to the practical realities of making them fast, stable, and visually breathtaking in real time.

[Yohei Nishitsuji](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/yoheinishitsuji/) and [Xor](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/xor/) explored the more poetic side of creative coding — fractals, perception, and the art of saying more with less (even within extreme constraints).

We also had the pleasure of publishing an interview with digital artist [Kakeru Taira](https://x.com/taira__kakeru), whose quiet, liminal 3D worlds transform everyday spaces into something hauntingly beautiful.

## Webzibition

If you’ve followed Codrops for a while, you’ll know that we’ve been curating website collections for many years, along with showcasing Sites of the Week in our newsletter. But with so many outstanding websites being launched all the time, we wanted something more immediate, something fresh that could be updated daily with the latest work from around the web. That idea became the Webzibition, a living collection that now features more than 2,200 carefully selected websites.

**[Start exploring the Webzibition](https://tympanus.net/codrops/webzibition/) and see what’s shaping the creative web right now.**

[![](https://codrops-1f606.kxcdn.com/codrops/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/webzibition-800x472.png?x60535)](https://tympanus.net/codrops/webzibition/)

## Case Studies

This year, we really wanted to take a closer look at some of the most inspiring work created for the web. Beyond showcasing inspiring websites, we wanted to open the door to what happens behind the scenes, how these projects came together, the design decisions that shaped them, and the technical thinking that brought them to life.

That led to a series of in-depth case studies by the creators themselves, whether studios or solo creatives. Some of the most educational ones explored how GSAP was used to power rich animation systems and immersive interactions, breaking down complex motion into clear, practical insights. These case studies offered a rare look into real-world workflows, showing not just what was built, but how and why it was done.

With the [Developer Spotlights](https://tympanus.net/codrops/tag/developer-spotlight/), we highlighted the journeys of developers and the work they are most proud of. These spotlights centered on how developers grew into their craft, the projects that shaped their thinking, and the kinds of challenges and explorations that continue to drive their curiosity and passion for building on the web.

The [Studio Spotlights](https://tympanus.net/codrops/tag/studio-spotlight/) extended this format to teams and agencies, combining a look at their journey as a studio with a showcase of selected projects. These features explored how studios came together, how they define their identity, and the work that best represents their vision, offering insight into the creative paths behind collaborative practice.

## Motion Highlights

If you are always looking for good motion inspiration, then you’ll love our [Motion Highlights](https://tympanus.net/codrops/category/articles/ui-interactions-animations-roundups/)! This year we’ve compiled 15 roundups of really nice animations we’ve loved! We’ve collected UI animation concepts, kinetic type experiments, exciting reels and so much more!

## GSAP Going Free: A Huge Moment for Creative Development

One of the most exciting moments this year was, without a doubt, [GSAP becoming fully free](https://gsap.com/blog/3-13/). Opening up powerful plugins like [SplitText](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/SplitText/) and [MorphSVG](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MorphSVGPlugin/) unlocked a whole new level of creative freedom, making it easier than ever to craft rich, expressive, and playful animations on the web.

A huge thank you to Webflow for making this possible and for continuing to support the creative community in such a meaningful way.

To see these and many other plugins in action, head over to the Creative Hub and explore the growing collection of [GSAP-powered demos](https://tympanus.net/codrops/hub/tag/gsap/), showcasing animation-driven experiments and real-world implementations from across the community.

And be sure to check out GSAP’s own recently launched [Demo Hub](https://demos.gsap.com/), an incredible treasure trove of animation techniques and effects to learn from and build upon.

## Partners Who Support Codrops
