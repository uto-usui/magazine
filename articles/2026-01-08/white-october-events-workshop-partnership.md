1.  [Tickets](#tickets)

I’m really excited to announce a new partnering with London-based events company [White October Events](http://www.whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/). The aim is to be able to offer semi-frequent _public_ workshops.

Whereas the majority of my workshops are for private clients—who need tailored advice and training around their particular product—there is undoubtedly a huge market for individuals from companies to be able to learn similar techniques in a more generalised and high-level manner.

I’m really looking forward to being able to offer these kinds of workshop through White October Events—a company with a great reputation and demonstrable experience running tech events.

The first two events are scheduled for [25 September, 2015](http://www.whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/event/css-workshop-september/) and [20 November, 2015](http://www.whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/event/css-workshop-november/) both in London, UK. Topics will include

-   how to assess, normalise, and **rationalise designs**;
-   how to split designs up into discrete **objects, abstractions and components**;
-   naming conventions and general **advice for naming things**;
-   the **ITCSS architecture** for managing CSS projects;
-   how to effectively **manage layout**;
-   **theming** and skinning;
-   how to use **Sass** to tie things together;
-   and anything **more** you think of on the day!
