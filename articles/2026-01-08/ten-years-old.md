Written by **Harry Roberts** on **CSS Wizardry**.

Ten years ago today, a seventeen-year old Harry decided to register the domain csswizardry.com. It was such a small and inconsequential decision at the time: I only bought the domain because [NuBlue](https://www.nublue.co.uk/), a British hosting firm, was running a promotional offer in which a .com domain and a year’s hosting was about £39 (I actually had to use my mother’s credit card, because I wasn’t old enough to have one of my own). As I clicked that checkout button, little did I know that that simple purchase would be the defining part of the next decade of my life.

I chose the name CSS Wizardry because I knew I wanted to start a blog showcasing CSS tricks and techniques, and I’d also just finished reading [Andy’s](http://andybudd.com/) [CSS Mastery](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1430223979?ie=UTF8&tag=blogography-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1430223979) which is a book that inspired me greatly. I actually loathe the name CSS Wizardry now, but it’s stuck too well for me to change it: I guess it’s here to stay. Incidentally, a lot of people think the name choice was making a play on the whole Harry/wizard thing—it wasn’t.

Fast forward a decade, and that whimsical purchase has probably been the most influential decision I ever made. What started off as an overly-confident teenager’s foray into front-end development ultimately led to my first job, a speaking career, and a full-time consultancy firm. I struggle to believe it, sometimes.

Over the last ten years I’ve been fortunate enough to work for [a number of companies](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/csswizardry), both large and small, as a salaried front-end developer; I’ve spoken and workshopped at [over 85 public events](https://csswizardry.com/speaking/#section:past-events) (and countless other private ones); I was able to start my own consultancy business through which I’ve worked with some [truly amazing clients](https://csswizardry.com/#section:clients); I’ve been able to travel the world visiting over 35 different countries; I’ve met countless new people and made many wonderful new friends; I’ve experienced more amazing things than I feel I deserve. It’s been a phenomenal journey and I’m grateful for it every single day. Truly, I’m the luckiest person alive.

As impersonal as it may seem through a blog post, I want to offer sincere thanks every single person that’s joined me on this journey; no matter how much or how little, you’ve all played a part. From colleagues, to managers, to bosses, to clients, to conferences, and everyone in between: thank you.

But it’s been hard work. A lot of continued hard work. Writing [over 200 articles](https://csswizardry.com/archive/), releasing [open-source projects](https://github.com/csswizardry), developing and sharing new methodologies and techniques, is all just a small part of what’s made this all possible. Looking back on ten whole years begins to put a lot of it into perspective.

Bill Gates once famously said that…

> \[m\]ost people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.

The CSS Wizardry journey, it turns out, has been a long one. People often ask me how I got to where I am, and how they can emulate it themselves. They’re often disheartened to hear that it’s taken me a decade, and to them I typically repeat a phrase I learned some time ago:

> The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.

Having this website changed and shaped my career. If you don’t have a blog, I urge you, start working on one this weekend. Your own blog, with your own content, at your own domain. It might just change your life.

## Facts and Figures

As CSS Wizardry is, first and foremost, a personal blog, it’s not as highly trafficked as, say, a site like CSS Tricks might be. That said, here are some interesting facts and figures[1](#fn:1) from the last decade:

-   There have been **8,033,982** visitors from **238 countries** who have been responsible for **14,237,772** pageviews.
-   The most highly trafficked single article has been [Creating a pure CSS dropdown menu](https://csswizardry.com/2011/02/creating-a-pure-css-dropdown-menu/), taking 10.17% of the total pageviews.
-   The most highly trafficked single day was **25 April 2013** with **34,374** visitors. **74.25%** of them were reading about [Shame.css](https://csswizardry.com/2013/04/shame-css/)
-   The most highly trafficked year was **2013**, which was when I was writing with a much higher frequency.
-   With **26.36%** of total visitors, **the US is the top location**, followed by the UK (10.74%), and India (6.66%).
-   I had one lonely visitor from **North Korea**.
