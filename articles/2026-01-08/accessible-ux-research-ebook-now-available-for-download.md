Smashing Library expands again! We’re so happy to announce our newest book, **_Accessible UX Research_**, is now **available for download** in eBook formats. Michele A. Williams takes us for a deep dive into the real world of UX testing, and provides a road map for including users with different abilities and needs in every phase of testing.

But the truth is, you don’t need to be conducting UX testing or even be a UX professional to get a lot out of this book. Michele gives in-depth descriptions of the **assistive technology we should all be familiar with**, in addition to disability etiquette, common pitfalls when creating accessible prototypes, and so much more. You’ll refer to this book again and again in your daily work.

The book has a teal cover that shows a three times three grid of windows in different architectural styles.

This is also your last chance to get your printed copy at our discounted presale price. We expect printed copies to start **shipping in early 2026**. We know you’ll love this book, but don’t just take our word for it — we asked a few industry experts to check out _Accessible UX Research_ too:

> ![Eric Bailey](https://files.smashing.media/articles/accessible-ux-research-pre-release/eric-bailey-opt.png)“_Accessible UX Research_ stands as a vital and necessary resource. In addressing disability at the User Experience Research layer, it helps to set an equal and equitable tone for products and features that resonates through the rest of the creation process. The book provides a **solid framework** for all aspects of conducting research efforts, including not only process considerations, but also importantly the mindset required to approach the work.
> 
> This is **the book I wish I had** when I was first getting started with my accessibility journey. It is a gift, and I feel so fortunate that Michele has chosen to share it with us all.”
> 
> Eric Bailey, Accessibility Advocate

> ![Devon Pershing](https://files.smashing.media/articles/accessible-ux-research-pre-release/devon-pershing-opt.png)“User research in accessibility is non-negotiable for actually meeting users’ needs, and this book is a **critical piece in the puzzle** of actually doing and integrating that research into accessibility work day to day.”
> 
> Devon Pershing, Author of _The Accessibility Operations Guidebook_

> ![Manuel Matuzović](https://files.smashing.media/articles/accessible-ux-research-pre-release/manuel-matuzovic-opt.png)“Our decisions as developers and designers are often based on recommendations, assumptions, and biases. Usually, this doesn’t work, because checking off lists or working solely from our own perspective can never truly represent the **depth of human experience**. Michele’s book provides you with the strategies you need to conduct UX research with diverse groups of people, challenge your assumptions, and create truly great products.”
> 
> Manuel Matuzović, Author of the _Web Accessibility Cookbook_

> ![Anna E. Cook](https://files.smashing.media/articles/accessible-ux-research-pre-release/anna-e-cook-opt.png)“This book is a vital resource on inclusive research. Michele Williams expertly breaks down key concepts, guiding readers through disability models, language, and etiquette. A **strong focus on real-world application** equips readers to conduct impactful, inclusive research sessions. By emphasizing diverse perspectives and proactive inclusion, the book makes a compelling case for accessibility as a core principle rather than an afterthought. It is a must-read for researchers, product-makers, and advocates!”

## About The Book

The book isn’t a checklist for you to complete as a part of your accessibility work. It’s a **practical guide to inclusive UX research**, from start to finish. If you’ve ever felt unsure how to include disabled participants, or worried about “getting it wrong,” this book is for you. You’ll get clear, practical strategies to make your research more inclusive, effective, and reliable.

Inside, you’ll learn how to:

-   **Plan research** that includes disabled participants from the start,
-   **Recruit participants** with disabilities,
-   **Facilitate sessions** that work for a range of access needs,
-   **Ask better questions** and avoid unintentionally biased research methods,
-   **Build trust and confidence** in your team around accessibility and inclusion.

The book also challenges common assumptions about disability and urges readers to **rethink what inclusion really means** in UX research and beyond. Let’s move beyond compliance and start doing research that reflects the full diversity of your users. Whether you’re in industry or academia, this book gives you the tools — and the mindset — to make it happen.

High-quality hardcover, 320 pages. Written by Dr. Michele A. Williams. Cover art by Espen Brunborg. **Print edition shipping early 2026.** eBook now available for download.

## Contents

1.  **Disability mindset**: For inclusive research to succeed, we must first confront our mindset about disability, typically influenced by ableism.
2.  **Diversity of disability**: Accessibility is not solely about blind screen reader users; disability categories help us unpack and process the diversity of disabled users.
3.  **Disability in the stages of UX research**: Disabled participants can and should be part of every research phase — formative, prototype, and summative.
4.  **Recruiting disabled participants**: Recruiting disabled participants is not always easy, but that simply means we need to learn strategies on where to look.
5.  **Designing your research**: While our goal is to influence accessible products, our research execution must also be accessible.
6.  **Facilitating an accessible study**: Preparation and communication with your participants can ensure your study logistics run smoothly.
7.  **Analyzing and reporting with accuracy and impact**: How you communicate your findings is just as important as gathering them in the first place — so prepare to be a storyteller, educator, and advocate.
8.  **Disability in the UX research field**: Inclusion isn’t just for research _participants_, it’s important for our _colleagues_ as well, as explained by blind UX Researcher Dr. Cynthia Bennett.
