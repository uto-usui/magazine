Here in Chrome Developer Relations, we've been talking a lot about [Baseline](https://web.dev/baseline) these days, from the arrival of new web interoperable features all the way to the tooling that's implementing Baseline. However, we've not spent much time _showing_ you how these features can all come together to help you build modern user experiences on the web without worrying about browser compatibility. Today, we're excited to announce the arrival of a new series to help you do just that: [Baseline in action](https://web.dev/series/baseline-in-action)!

We've joined forces with [OddBird](https://www.oddbird.net/) to bring you Baseline in action. This series shows you demos of various Baseline features used together for different use cases, and are paired with articles that go deep into detail on these features. We have three demos available at this time:

1.  [`<dialog>` and `popover`](https://web.dev/articles/baseline-in-action-dialog-popover)
2.  [An image gallery using Baseline features](https://web.dev/articles/baseline-in-action-image-gallery)
3.  [Container queries and units](https://web.dev/articles/baseline-in-action-container-queries)

These demos are only the start. As time goes on, we'll be working with the talented people at OddBird to release additional articles and demos in this series for the rest of 2025 and into 2026. We hope these demos inspire you to pick up features that are now Baseline. [Check out Baseline in action](https://web.dev/series/baseline-in-action) today!
