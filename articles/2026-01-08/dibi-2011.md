I’m heading up to [DIBI 2011](http://www.dibiconference.com/) with [Dan Bentley](https://twitter.com/dan_bentley) and a few other guys I know. _However_, I’d love to meet some people I only know through that Twitter thingy so if you’re going and you fancy grabbing a beer please email/[tweet at me](https://twitter.com/?status=Hey,%20@csswizardry,%20beer%20at%20DIBI!). I’ve never been to a conference before and I’m itching to meet people!

**Email:** csswizardry \[at\] gmail \[dot\] com.

Oh, and [this is my ugly mug](http://www.flickr.com/photos/csswizardry/3480159019/in/photostream)\* if you want to be able to recognise me.

-   May be fatter in real life.

Cheers, _Harry_
