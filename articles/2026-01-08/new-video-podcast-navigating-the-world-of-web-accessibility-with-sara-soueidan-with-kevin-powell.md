[Kevin](https://www.kevinpowell.co/) and I been planning this podcast for months and our schedules finally aligned and we made it happen.

We originally planned to chat for a bit… but we had so much fun that almost two hours flew by without us noticing 😅

We covered:

-   Defining web accessibility and why it matters
-   How we each became more aware of it (our accessibility origin stories)
-   Raising awareness and addressing common pushback by debunking accessibility myths
-   HTML semantics and ARIA
-   Screen readers and the accessibility tree
-   New CSS features and how CSS affects accessibility
-   Keeping up with CSS
-   Course creation and the Practical Accessibility course
-   …and we talked a little bit about our shared interest in cooking, fermentation, nutrition, and our favorite meals 🍲

If you’ve ever been curious about web accessibility and how it relates to your work as a front-end designer or developer, and are interested in a technical deep dive into HTML semantics, ARIA, and CSS, or just want to hear two nerds geeking out and laughing along the way — give it a watch (or a listen)!

I would love to hear what you think!
