Technology doesn’t stand still, and neither do we.

For years, Chicago JavaScript has been a place where developers could connect, share knowledge, and grow together. We’ve loved exploring new frameworks, tackling challenges in frontend development, and building community among JavaScript enthusiasts. But over time, we've noticed something exciting: our conversations have been evolving.

We weren’t just discussing JavaScript anymore.

We were discussing user experience, product strategy, design systems, testing, agile delivery, and everything else that goes into creating exceptional digital products. We realized that what brings this community together isn’t just a programming language, it’s the shared goal of building and delivering meaningful technology.

## Introducing Digital Delivery Chicago

We’re thrilled to announce that the **Chicago JavaScript** meetup is becoming **Digital Delivery Chicago**, a meetup for everyone involved in designing, managing, building, and shipping great software.

Whether you’re a frontend or backend developer, a UX/UI designer, a QA engineer, or a product owner, Digital Delivery Chicago is your place to connect, learn, and level up.

Our discussions will explore a wider spectrum of digital product development:

-   Coding best practices and modern frameworks
    
-   User experience and interface design
    
-   Product management and delivery processes
    
-   Quality assurance and testing
    
-   Collaboration and cross-functional teamwork
    

Our goal is to create a space where design, development, and delivery intersect, because when we understand how our roles connect, we produce better products and stronger teams.

## Why the Change?

Technology evolves. We should too.

As software becomes increasingly central to our lives, the way we build it has become more interconnected. The most successful digital teams understand that no single role works in isolation. By learning from each other and seeing how our work fits into the larger picture, we build tools and products that matter. And gain a deeper appreciation for every aspect of the process.

That’s what Digital Delivery Chicago is all about.
