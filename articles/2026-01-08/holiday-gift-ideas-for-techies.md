It’s that time of the year: the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales are on, and the annual festive marketing blitz is just around the corner – or already underway. It makes now a good time to start thinking about gifts, but techies can be a tough crowd for this, as we often already own the practical things we need.

In order to help you give gifts which are actually wanted this year, Elin, of this publication, and I have put together a list of ideas in this article. Alongside personal recommendations, we’ve also crowdsourced recommendations from fellow techies on [X](https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1989351758523756905?s=20), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/gergely.pragmaticengineer.com/post/3m5lxw3t4zc2y), and [Threads](https://www.threads.com/@gergelyorosz_/post/DRCqNbojGTd?xmt=AQF0XhwXRV9ZVcabQdTbg1ChEesNhZzlLigLbjOgP9m_tQ), covering:

1.  Office accessories
    
2.  Computer add-ons
    
3.  Health and well-being
    
4.  Gadgets
    
5.  Gaming and games
    
6.  Travel & wearables
    
7.  Books and stationery
    
8.  Kitchen goodies
    

Many products listed below are currently discounted in the sales, and the Pragmatic Engineer is also offering a very special [Black Friday / Cyber Monday deal](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/0ea36188) for annual subscriptions. [Claim it here](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/0ea36188) until Monday.

_Programming note: this week, we’ll have a podcast episode tomorrow (Wednesday), and no edition of The Pulse on Thursday. Regular programming resumes next week after Thanksgiving._

**[Ember Temperature Control Mug](https://ember.com/)** – keeps coffee or tea warm, even when it’s forgotten about because you’re focused on coding or other tasks. A hot drink stays drinkable for up to 1.5 hours, thanks to its built-in battery that charges on a nifty wireless-charging coaster.

_Clever: built-in battery keeps drinks warm_

**Tumblers and coffee mugs** that keep drinks at the desired temperature can make it easier to stay hydrated throughout the day. They are insulated, made from stainless steel, and make great gifts for anyone who works at a desk. Popular brands include [Stanley](https://www.stanley1913.com/collections/tumblers), [Yeti](https://www.yeti.com/drinkware/tumblers), and [Thermoflask](https://mythermoflask.com/). You can also [search for](https://www.google.com/search?q=stainless+steel+tumbler) stainless steel tumblers.

_Tumblers: hydration at work or during a commute_

**CO2 monitor.** One of my personal favorite recent purchases is a carbon dioxide monitor for my office. When CO2 concentration is high (above 1,000 ppm), it’s harder to focus and easier to become drowsy. A monitor detects when levels are raised, meaning you can make changes like open the window, or raise the matter of ventilation at work. In my opinion, you can’t go wrong with almost [any CO2 monitor](https://www.google.com/search?q=co2+monitor).

**Programmable mini-desk terminal**. These are always a hit for devs, and a popular option is the [Ulanzi TC001 Smart Pixel Clock 2882](https://www.ulanzi.com/products/ulanzi-pixel-smart-clock-2882). It comes by default as a clock, but can be custom programmed; for example, to show a pomodoro timer (25-minute countdown).

_Customizing the Ulanzi Smart Pixel Clock to work as a Pomodoro timer_

To program it – and build your own custom matrix clocks – you need to flash a custom firmware [like AWTRIX3](https://blueforcer.github.io/awtrix3/#/). See more details on the [Ulanzi blog](https://www.ulanzi.com/blogs/news/ulanzi-tc001-smart-pixel-clock-the-ultimate-pixel-art-clock-for-your-creative-world), and on the AWTRIX3 [getting started page](https://github.com/Blueforcer/awtrix3).

**Wired / wireless charging stations.** Almost all new phones and small devices are shipping with USB-C ports, so a USB-C-only charging station is increasingly practical. There’s [no shortage of options](https://www.google.com/search?q=usbc+charging+dock), and here’s a tasteful variant: the [Oakwood Dual Dock](https://oakywood.shop/products/dual-dock?variant=41264825925693)

_Oakwood Dual Dock: a USB-C wired charging station_

In his gift guide, Lenny Ratchisky [recommends](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/a-holiday-gift-guide-for-tech-people) the [Belkin MagSafe 3-in-1 charger](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DL8CK73P).

Techies unavoidably spend A LOT of time with our computers, so a premium accessory often makes for a good gift.

**A comfortable mouse.** Given we use one all day, a mouse that feels good for your hand and that can be customized, should be a solid choice. The [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/mx-master-3s) is recommended by software dev [Brian Cooley](https://x.com/blcooley/status/1989356167475380461?s=20). I’m personally a fan of [Logitech Mice](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/c/mice); they come in all shapes and sizes, with both wireless and wired versions.

_Logitech MX Master 3_

**Quality noise-cancelling headphones.** These can offer a massive quality-of-work improvement for anyone in an open-plan office, coffee shops, or who likes to get in the zone with some music. My go-to pair is the [Bose QuietComfort Ultra](https://www.bose.com/p/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones/QCUH-HEADPHONEARN.html); I have one in the office, and one in my backpack at all times. Other popular options include the [Sony WH-1000XM5](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/wh1000xm5-b), the [Apple AirPods Max](https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/), and the [Sennheiser Momentum 4](https://us.sennheiser-hearing.com/products/momentum-4-wireless-se).

**Mechanical keyboard.** These provide superior typing and improved durability. A popular brand is Das [Keyboard](https://www.daskeyboard.com/). Other choices include [Logitech mechanical keyboards](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/shop/p/g915-low-profile-wireless-mechanical-gaming-keyboard), the quiet [Razer Pro Type Ultra](https://www.razer.com/productivity/razer-pro-type-ultra), and [many others](https://www.google.com/search?q=mechanical+keyboard).

**Quality microphone.** For those who spend a lot of time on video calls, upgrading from the built-in laptop mic can be a nice improvement for those on the other end of a call. [The Shure MV7](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/mv7?variant=MV7%252B-K) is a popular choice. For a more compact microphone, the [Yeti Nano](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/shop/p/yeti-nano-usb-microphone) can also work well.

**Massage vouchers.** Most of us working in tech spend too much time staring at screens, so a massage voucher should be appreciated.

**Experiences.** Of course, a great gift doesn’t have to be an object, and a few less conventional ideas have been successes with techies, according to [Candy Evans](https://x.com/creva/status/1989359014367694903?s=20):

-   [Walking with alpacas](https://www.google.com/search?q=walking+with+alpacas)
    
-   [Making French pastries](https://www.google.com/search?q=making+french+pastries+class)
    
-   [Whisky tasting](https://www.google.com/search?q=Whisky%20tasting)
    

There is much more, like [high rope courses](https://www.google.com/search?q=high+rope+course), [indoor skydiving](https://www.google.com/search?q=indoor+skydiving), and even [bobsledding](https://www.google.com/search?q=Bobsledding+near+me). Get creative: it could make for something very memorable!

[Escape rooms](https://www.google.com/search?q=escape+room+near+me) are a fun activity, usually for groups of 2-6. You need to solve a series of puzzles, usually within an hour, and work together to succeed under pressure of the countdown.

_An escape room I enjoyed with a group: [The Vault](https://www.sherlocked.nl/experiences/the-vault), in Amsterdam_

[“Escape room in a box”](https://store.thamesandkosmos.com/collections/escape-room-games?page=1) is a companion concept, where you have an escape room experience at home, as a board game focused on puzzle solving.

**[WHOOP subscription](https://www.whoop.com/nl/en/).** A return recommendation from last year: track biometrics such as skin temperature, blood oxygen level, and more. The battery lasts more than 2 weeks, and a subscription offers the option to upgrade to the latest models.

**Coffee, tea, matcha.** These are rarely a miss and many vendors offer subscription coffee or tea products. Here are two personal recommendations:

-   **[Terminal](https://www.terminal.shop/)**: coffee subscription for devs, built by devs, accessible from your terminal. It has [an API as well](https://www.terminal.shop/api), and you can place an order using SSH. Ships to the US.
    
-   **[Keats&Co](https://good.store/collections/keats-and-co-loose-leaf-tea-and-coffee)** – coffee and tea, including subscription. All profits go to charity.
    

**[Apple Watch Ultra](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-ultra-3/).** I got mine this year and am very happy with it. It provides basic sleep tracking, workout tracking, and notifications – and also supports payments (very convenient on vacation, or if you want to be phone-free.) It motivated me to take sleep and workouts more seriously. The battery lasts around 2 days – much less than the Whoop, but I find it manageable.

**[Sunbasin soap and shampoo bars](https://good.store/collections/sun-basin-soap-bar-soap-and-shampoo-bars)**. These offer a lathery, soapy clean, and the shampoo comes in bar form, which is novel and makes it convenient for travel.

**Sunrise alarm clock.** Wake up easier with an alarm clock that simulates a sunrise. One popular edition is the [Philips SmartSleep Wake-up Light](https://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/HF3520_60/smartsleep). There is a large variety; just [search “sunrise alarm clocks”.](https://www.google.com/search?q=sunrise+alarm+clock)

**Foldable walking pad.** I have one at home, and it’s been a moderate success. I originally tried it as an under-the-desk walking pad – which was _okay_, but I felt dizzy when walking at higher speeds for extended periods. Nonetheless, plenty of techies swear by its efficiency, and they’re increasingly affordable. Just [search “walking pads”](https://www.google.com/search?q=walking+pad) for options.

**[Flipper Zero.](https://flipperzero.one/)** When I ask techies about gifts they’ve enjoyed, the number one recommendation is still the Flipper Zero [from two years ago](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/139241786/gadgets-and-tinkering). A multi-tool for security folks and those who enjoy hacking around with signals and hardware. Practical use cases include turning it into a universal infrared remote, a Bluetooth remote, and testing and debugging remote frequency (RF) gear like car key fobs with it. It’s also a great way to get hands-on with RF, NFC/RFID and embedded protocols, and basic firmware development.

**[Boox Palma 2](https://shop.boox.com/products/palma2)**. Phone-sized tablets with e-ink that also _kind of_ work like a phone – except without phone calls and SMS support. It runs open Android and has Google Play support. So, you can install and use Android apps on a minimalist device that also helps with being more mindful about screentime. It has integrated speakers, a camera, Bluetooth – and the Palma Pro 2 model actually does support a SIM card for cellular data.

**Small 3D printer.** Practical things techies can print include cable organizers, monitor risers, mouse trays, or tool holders for the desk. But then, there’s so much more you can do, as it can print pretty much any 3D model! A popular recommendation is the [Bambu Lab A1 Mini 3D Printer](https://eu.store.bambulab.com/products/a1-mini).

**[YubiKey.](https://www.yubico.com/)** A hardware two-factor authentication passkey that is generally more secure than app-based 2FA, and also more resistant to phishing. If you plan to gift one, it’s worth giving two, so the person setting up the Yubikey [has a backup key](https://support.yubico.com/s/article/How-to-register-your-spare-key) – with key services like email, banking, and others – in case it gets lost.

**[Nintendo Switch 2](https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/)** – an upgrade on its predecessor with better performance, more storage, and an improved Joy-Con design.

_ModRetro Chromatic: Game Boy vibes_

The game catalog is smaller than ideal – but in July this year, Luckey shared big plans, [writing](https://modretro.com/blogs/blog/the-future-is-retro):

> “We have a huge slate of content coming from some of the best developers in the industry, starting with an all-new physical Tetris cartridge that will come bundled with each and every Chromatic, just as it did with every original Game Boy® released in North America. We will also be launching all-physical re-releases and remasters of classic Game Boy® titles, entirely new IP from incredible indie developers, first-time launches of Game Boy® games that were canceled before release, and even some titles that were canceled before the public ever found out about them.”

**[Playdate](https://play.date/)**. A tiny-handled homage to old-school gaming. The crank on the side brings a new type of gaming experience, and the platform is home to lots of clever indie games. This device has become a family favorite in our home, and was also a recommendation in the [2023 gift guide](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/holiday-season-gift-ideas-for-techies).

**Board games.** Playing board games is a great group activity. A recent guest on the [Pragmatic Engineer Podcast](https://youtu.be/CQmI4XKTa0U?si=jzViJWGfGxeFwZvk&t=6412), Martin Fowler, is a big fan of them, so I asked which one he recommends. He said:

> “It’s a tricky one because it’s a little bit like saying ‘I’m really into watching movies. Which one would you recommend?’ There are so many different tastes.
> 
> If I wanted to pick one that is not too complicated to get into, but still has a lot of richness: at the moment I would pick the game Concordia. Fairly abstract in its nature, but it’s easy to get into and it’s got a good bit of decision making in the process.”

_A selection from my bookshelf_

From my collection of titles:

-   **[Tidy First](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/tidy-first/9781098151232/)** by Kent Beck. A short, impactful read. Check out an excerpt: [Dead code, getting untangled, and coupling versus decoupling](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/dead-code-getting-untangled-and-coupling)
    
-   **[The Engineering Executive’s Primer](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-engineering-executives/9781098149475/)** by Will Larson. Read an excerpt: [Getting an engineering executive job](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/getting-an-engineering-executive).
    
-   **[Frictionless](https://developerexperiencebook.com/)** by Nicole Forsgren and Abi Noda. AI can generate code in minutes, so why does shipping software still take forever? This book answers that question, and offers practical advice on how to reduce friction in dev teams. Released just last week.
    
-   **[Engineering management for the rest of us](https://www.engmanagement.dev/)** by Sarah Drasner. An approachable, practical title about how to be a better engineering leader.
    
-   **[AI Engineering](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/)** by Chip Huyen. Probably the best book on AI Engineering. Read an excerpt: [The AI Engineering stack](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-ai-engineering-stack).
    
-   **[The Software Engineer’s Guidebook](https://www.engguidebook.com/)** by myself, is now available in hardcover and makes for a good gift. [More on why I wrote this book.](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-engineers-guidebook)
    
-   **[The Scaling Era](https://www.stripe.press/scaling)**: An Oral History of AI, 2019–2025 by Dwarkesh Patel. An educational overview of the evolution of LLMs. Worth reading to understand more.

**Stone paper notebooks.** Stone paper is a tea-proof and waterproof sheet – which makes this format really practical.

**[Analog TO-DO list](https://ugmonk.com/en-nl/pages/analog).** Analog is an offline TO-DO system that works like this:

-   Write 10 tasks on a “Today” card at the beginning of the day
    
-   Mark tasks as “in progress”, “delegated” or “completed”
    
-   Move unfinished tasks either to a new “Today” card, or to a “Next” or “Someday” card
    

With so many digital TO-DO lists, an offline version feels refreshing!
