## Advent Calendars

Happy new year! In December I was lucky enough to write articles for three different advent calendars: HTMHell, 12 days of web and the Fronteers Advent calendar.

### [Starting off right: Where autofocus shines](https://htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2024/2/) on HTMHell

the `autofocus` attribute is one of my favorite ways to improve very specific interactions on HTML pages, and in the article I explain what those are, where to add it and where to definitely _not_ it as well.

### [CSS box-decoration-break](https://12daysofweb.dev/2024/css-box-decoration-break/) on 12 Days of Web

box-decoration-break is a CSS property that lets you decide what the decorations of a box should do if that box is broken across multiple lines. If that sentences reads like gibberish to you, check out the article!

### [What determines the accessible name of an element?](https://www.fronteers.nl/en/blog/2024/12/what-determines-the-accessible-name-of-an-element) on Fronteers

The accessible name of an element is how the browser passes an element to assistive technologies like screen readers or braille displays, and forms the way someone who cannot (fully) see a site consumes the content.

This article was originally written in Dutch, so if you prefer that you can read it here: [Wat bepaalt de toegankelijke naam van een element?](https://www.fronteers.nl/nl/blog/2024/12/wat-bepaalt-de-toegankelijke-naam-van-een-element).

All the best for 2025!
