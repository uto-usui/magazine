## ConTejas Code Podcast

[Web](https://kilianvalkhof.com/category/web/), 21 August 2024, < 1

I’ve been a fan of Tejas’ podcast since he started it. He is an extremely gracious host that asks interesting questions and brings out the best in the people he has on. I was thrilled when he asked me to record an episode with him.

We recorded this back in April when I was struggling to get [Polypane 19](https://polypane.app/blog/polypane-19-workflow-improvements/) out, so you’ll hear us get into the technical details as well as business considerations that entails, as well as many other things!

Thanks again to Tejas for having me on and letting me dive deep into some of the technical details of Polypane. If you enjoyed this episode I’d love to hear from you, and do check out some of the other episodes!
