[Web](https://kilianvalkhof.com/category/web/), 30 July 2025, < 1

Last Friday I went on the Syntax.fm Supper Club podcast to chat with Scott and Wes about everything Polypane. We go pretty deep into some of the features and in hindsight it’s funny how most of it boils down to “I needed this feature so I built it”. I had a great time geeking out \[…\]
