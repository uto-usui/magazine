I’ve [written](https://csswizardry.com/2019/03/cache-control-for-civilians/) and [spoken](https://slideslive.com/39021005/cache-rules-everything) many, many times about the `Cache-Control` response header and its many directives, but one thing I haven’t covered before—and something I don’t think many developers are even aware of—is the `Cache-Control` _request_ header. Unless you know your caching well, those two links in the first sentence will make this article a lot easier to understand. Maybe pop them open in another tab as a reference.

Let’s go!

## `Cache-Control` Recap

As developers, we’re most used to `Cache-Control` as the preferred way of instructing caches (usually browsers) on how they should store responses (if at all), and what to do once their cache lifetime is up. Maybe something like this:

```
Cache-Control: max-age=2147483648, immutable
```

There’s a lot more to it than that, which you can read about in my 2019 piece, [Cache-Control for Civilians](https://csswizardry.com/2019/03/cache-control-for-civilians/)

One thing we’re probably less used to is `Cache-Control`’s employment as a _request_ header.

In a nutshell, the `Cache-Control` request header determines whether the browser retrieves content from the cache or forces a network request. It’s also used by intermediaries such as CDNs to work out whether they should serve a response themselves, or keep passing the request back upstream to origin.

It’s a way for the client to force freshness.

This means that the most common way you’re ever likely to see a `Cache-Control` request header is when you refresh or hard refresh a page. Honestly, that’s mostly it.

All browsers behave a little differently between refreshes, hard refreshes, and run of the mill [revalidation](https://speakerdeck.com/csswizardry/cache-rules-everything?slide=10).

## Refresh

In **Chrome**, even if the page is still [fresh](https://speakerdeck.com/csswizardry/cache-rules-everything?slide=14), refreshing it will dispatch a request to the network with the following request headers:

```
Cache-Control: max-age=0
[If-Modified-Since|If-None-Match]
```

-   `Cache-Control: max-age=0` just means after zero seconds, revalidate this resource. This isn’t incredibly strictly enforced so it’s technically a weak instruction to revalidate. More on that later.
-   The `If-Modified-Since` or `If-None-Match` headers are revalidation request headers that are used to compare the current version of the response with the target version on the network.

All other subresources on the page are fetched as per their caching headers, so there is no different or specific behaviour here.

In **Firefox** the behaviour is a little different. Refreshing a still-fresh page results in the following request headers:

```
[If-Modified-Since|If-None-Match]
```

No `Cache-Control` request header at all, just the relevant revalidation headers.

Again, all of the page’s subresources are treated as normal.

**Safari** is different still, and generally seems much more aggressive with its cache busting. Refreshing the same still-fresh page in Safari gives the following request headers:

```
Cache-Control: no-cache
Pragma: no-cache
```

We have a `Cache-Control` request header, this time with a `no-cache` directive. While this is functionally equivalent to `max-age=0`, the spec speaks much more clearly that `no-cache` means that a cache MUST NOT use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server. We also have the first appearance of `Pragma`, also carrying `no-cache`. `Pragma` is an incredibly outdated header that serves as a backward compatibility measure for HTTP/1.0 caches. Safari including this here is a very defensive measure!

Again, all other subresources are treated as they would be normally.

All browsers exhibit some similarities and some differences.

-   Even if the main document was still fresh in HTTP cache, a refresh will always put a request out onto the network in all browsers.
-   Chrome and Firefox emit revalidation headers which mean that, even though we’ve refreshed the page, we might still get served our locally cached version (`304`) if it’s still valid.
-   Firefox doesn’t emit a `Cache-Control` header, making it the least aggressive of the three.
-   Safari is by far the most aggressive, emitting both `Cache-Control` and `Pragma` headers, and no revalidation headers for potential reuse. Safari will always return a `200` response to a refresh.

## Hard Refresh

Things are a little different when it comes to a hard refresh. Hard refreshes are usually a sign of user frustration and that something is badly broken or outdated. To this end, browsers begin upping the ante here.

In **all browsers**, a hard refresh causes both the main document and all of its subresources to be requested with the following:

```
Cache-Control: no-cache
Pragma: no-cache
```

Key things to note:

-   No browser emits a revalidation header, meaning a `304` is not possible. We’re always guaranteed a fresh response.
-   Chrome switched from `max-age=0` to `no-cache`. This is a clear signal of intent that a hard refresh is more aggressive than a regular one.
-   Safari’s behaviour remains unchanged, which means that as far as the main document is concerned, a refresh and a hard refresh are equivalent.

Note that this all applies to the main document and all of its subresources—even [`immutable`](https://csswizardry.com/2019/03/cache-control-for-civilians/#immutable) assets—so everything on the page is now guaranteed fresh. `304` responses are not possible.

### `max-age=0` vs `no-cache`

Both of these directives behave incredibly similarly: `max-age=0` means the response is considered stale after zero seconds and therefore should be revalidated, and `no-cache` means don’t fetch this response from cache without revalidating it first.

Where they differ is that `max-age=0` permits caches to reuse a response if revalidation isn’t possible (e.g. no network access); `no-cache` is much stricter—it means the cache must always revalidate before releasing a response, or return an error if revalidation fails.

## Revalidation

In the case that a user hasn’t refreshed the page, but instead they have a file in their cache that is now considered [stale](https://speakerdeck.com/csswizardry/cache-rules-everything?slide=15), the browser needs to check with the server whether or not it needs a new copy, or if it can reuse and renew the previously cached version. This is called _revalidation_ and is when the `If-Modified-Since` or `If-None-Match` headers come into play.

-   **`If-Modified-Since`** is used to check a file against its `Last-Modified` response header.
-   **`If-None-Match`** is used to check a file against its `Etag` response header.

When a file needs revalidating, **all browsers** behave the same:

```
[If-Modified-Since|If-None-Match]
```

They attach the relevant revalidation header, which will result in either a `200` or `304` response in most cases. This is unremarkable other than the fact that no browser attaches a `Cache-Control` request header at this point.

Each of these use cases was browser-defined, very much out of our hands as web developers, but there are scenarios when we might want to (and can!) add our own `Cache-Control` request headers. Think of these scenarios as incredibly aggressive, incredibly defensive bidirectional caching rules to absolutely guarantee that no caches anywhere along with request–response lifecycle will retain a copy of a response. By setting `Cache-Control` at both ends, we have a double-pronged approach to our strategy. A very cautious approach.

### Realtime Data

Imagine you’re building a sports betting site or stock trading app: realtime price updates are incredibly important, and all data must be up to date, _always_. You’d serve your _responses_ with something like:

```
Cache-Control: no-store
```

…and make your _requests_ with something like:

```
fetch("https://api.website.com/data", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    "Cache-Control": "no-store",
  }
})
```

This is the bare minimum for modern and compliant caches, but the hyper-defensive version would be more like:

```
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, max-age=0, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
```

…on your responses, and this in your requests:

```
fetch("https://api.website.com/data", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    "Cache-Control": "no-store, no-cache, max-age=0",
    "Pragma": "no-cache"
  }
})
```

The latter two examples are overkill and do contain a lot of redundancy, but they also won’t do any harm.

Note that if the data is also potentially sensitive and contains user-specific data, you’d want to [add `private` to your `Cache-Control` response headers](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7303763824388558848/).

### Offline Applications

If you have an offline application, you can use `only-if-cached` to _only_ serve a response if it’s in cache, otherwise returning a `504`.

```
fetch("https://api.website.com/offline-data", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    "Cache-Control": "only-if-cached"
  }
})
```

Adding this request header ensures that the request would never hit the network.

While `only-if-cached` might not be useful for most web pages, it can be handy for offline-first applications, such as PWAs or news readers that prefer using stored content rather than attempting a network request that might fail.

## Final Takeaways

-   Browsers automatically send a mix `Cache-Control`, `Pragma`, or revalidation headers in refresh and hard refresh scenarios.
-   `max-age=0` and `no-cache` both trigger revalidation, but `no-cache` is much stricter and requires a fresh response.
-   You can manually use `Cache-Control` in requests when you need realtime data or offline-first apps.
-   To force freshness, use:
    
    ```
    Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, max-age=0
    ```
    
-   To build offline-first apps, consider:
    
    ```
    Cache-Control: only-if-cached
    ```
