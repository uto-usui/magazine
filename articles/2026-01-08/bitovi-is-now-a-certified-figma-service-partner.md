Bitovi is excited to announce that we’re now an [**official Figma Service Partner**](https://www.bitovi.com/partnerships/figma)—a milestone that reflects our long-standing commitment to world-class design systems, high-velocity product development, and pragmatic AI adoption.

For years, our teams have used Figma to bridge the gap between design and development, streamline workflows, and accelerate delivery. Now, as a [Figma Service Partner](https://www.figma.com/partners/find-a-service-partner/bitovi/), we’re doubling down on helping organizations build scalable, consistent, future-proof design practices.

## Why this partnership matters

### 1\. Design systems that scale across teams and products

We build design systems that go beyond UI kits. They enforce brand alignment, encode UX best practices, and empower cross-functional teams to ship faster with fewer defects.  
Figma’s component architecture and tokens ecosystem give us the perfect foundation to create systems that are durable, maintainable, and deeply integrated into engineering workflows.

As a partner, we can now help companies mature their design operations even faster—from initial audits to full-scale system rollout and governance.

### 2\. Accelerating AI adoption and design automation

AI is reshaping design and product development—and Bitovi is at the forefront. Through custom plugins, workflow automation, and AI-powered generation tools, we help teams use Figma as a hub for intelligent design operations.

This includes:

-   Piping Figma designs directly into GitHub’s cloud coding agent through MCP, giving AI full design context for implementation
-   Automatically generating real code components from Figma frames, aligned to your tech stack, design system, naming conventions, and token architecture
-   Creating structured implementation tasks (including Jira tickets when needed) that are informed by the actual design’s constraints and engineering requirementsUsing LLM-powered audit tools to evaluate accessibility, design consistency, and UX heuristics
-   Smart workflows that minimize repetitive manual work

These solutions boost velocity now while laying the groundwork for long-term AI maturity.

### 3\. Stronger design/dev connection and faster delivery

Bitovi’s history is rooted in UI engineering—and that expertise shapes how we approach design in Figma. We focus on the connective tissue:

-   Component libraries mapped directly to code
-   Seamless collaboration between designers and engineers
-   Shared vocabularies through tokens and standards
-   Clear, structured handoff steps that minimize rework

The result: teams move from concept to production dramatically faster, with fewer bottlenecks and more room for innovation.

## Level up with Figma training from Bitovi

As a [Figma Partner](https://www.bitovi.com/partnerships/figma), we now offer hands-on training that helps teams master the platform—whether they’re adopting Figma for the first time or scaling beyond a single product team.

[**Explore Figma training opportunities →**](https://www.bitovi.com/partnerships/figma-training)

Our training covers design systems, tokens, component architecture, advanced prototyping, AI workflows, and design-to-dev collaboration. It’s designed for designers, engineers, and product teams who want to move faster together.

## Let’s build what’s next

We’re thrilled to expand our work with Figma and help teams unlock new levels of speed, quality, and collaboration. Whether you need a full design system, custom AI workflows, or team-wide training, we’re here to help.
