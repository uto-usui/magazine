Independent writing is brought to you via my wonderful [Supporters](https://csswizardry.com/supporters/).

An article I wrote for Smashing Magazine has [just gone live](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/14/technical-web-typography-guidelines-and-techniques/). It’s all about technical, micro-typography and how it can be used to great effect on the web. It won’t teach you how to be a better designer, but it should show you how to best set type on the web.

It’s a pretty epic offering but I assure you, it’s worth it.

Enjoy!

It is worth noting that Wordpress’ editor has stripped some of the semantic and (ironically) typographical niceties from the post. I have a semantically rich original copy knocking about that I drafted the article up in (in HTML)
