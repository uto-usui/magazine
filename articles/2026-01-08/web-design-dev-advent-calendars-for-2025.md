![A boxed Charlie Brown lonely tree (a spindly pine stick with a single ornament bending it to the ground) on a carpet of concentric black and white diamonds.](https://adrianroselli.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-advent.jpg)

The advent calendar I wanted to use for the photo hasn’t arrived yet, so enjoy this box of tree.

Web developers around the world have for years given a nod to [Saturnalia](https://aardrian.tumblr.com/post/105306017461/heydonworks-happy-to-report-ive-received-the) solstice [Isaac Newton’s birthday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#Early_life) Yule [wassailing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassailing) mummering [end of Gregorian calendar year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_between_Julian_and_Gregorian_calendars) Christmas with advent calendars covering web-related topics. As a result, you may (should) recognize some of the ones listed below.

Every year I miss a few on December 1, so add a comment or [hit me up on the Fediverse](https://toot.cafe/@aardrian) if you have more. I delayed posting again this year because I am a bit tired of people who just copy the entire thing and share their version on the socials. Also, this content originally appeared on AdrianRoselli.com and if you aren’t reading it there then the site you are on is a thieving site which should be held in the most contemptible disdain. Happy holidays!

I have not included advent calendars that are single blog posts, image-only efforts with inaccessible images, or delivered only via email. It would be a terrible gift from me to you if you sign up for spam or end up taking advice from organizations that are clearly bad at advice. Maybe next year I’ll ban LinkedIn posts. I also don’t evaluate the quality of the calendars (hard to do when most have barely opened their first day).

I am happy to see more of the calendar creators are available on the fediverse. I look forward to it being all of them. I resent those who are still on Twitter, so if you have a better social link for any of them, please let me know.

[HTMHell Advent Calendar](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/) is Manuel Matuzović’s doubling-down on the theology of HTML. And Christianity. One of those. Anyway, each day will reveal an article, talk, or tool that focuses on HTML.

## Advent of Code ([@ericwastl@hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/@ericwastl))

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) provides a small programming puzzle each of twelve days (that’s a change this year). They are stand-alone, but supposedly have a general theme. They also use different technologies so there is some variety as well. This year, in honor of 10 years, [Eric Wastl made a music video for it](https://youtu.be/zF_4miExauw).

## 24 Jours de Web ([@ParisWeb@mamot.fr](https://mamot.fr/@ParisWeb))

[24 Jours de Web](https://www.24joursdeweb.fr/) is back as an advent calendar for web folk. Written in French, it is clearly primarily targeted at French speakers, but a round of Google Translate will open it up to far more readers (like me).

## Performance Calendar ([@stoyan.org@bsky.app](https://bsky.app/profile/stoyan.org))

[Performance Calendar](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2025/) hails this as the speed geek’s favorite time of the year, ostensibly because of the tips it has been offering each December since 2009.

If you know Japanese, I welcome any corrections. It has been running since 2013.

## Selfhtml Advent ([@SELFHTML@bildung.social](https://bildung.social/@selfhtml))

## 24 Pull Requests ([@24PullRequests@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@24pullrequests))

[24 Pull Requests](http://24pullrequests.com/) is less an advent calendar than it is an effort to mobilize developers. The goal is to get developers to send a pull request every day in December (up to Christmas), thereby supporting your favorite open source projects. I’m not sure it’s active in the sense that it posts, but you can still do your own contributions of course.

## Perl Weekly Challenge Advent ([@PerlWChallenge](https://twitter.com/PerlWChallenge))

## Advent(ure) in System Seeing

[Advent(ure) in System Seeing](https://www.ruthmalan.com/Advent/About.html) provides a daily activity to help you practice how you might perceive or understand a system so you can better design it. Collected, these become a journal of prompts for your system design and architecture work.

For example, head over to the [2025 #id24 schedule](https://inclusivedesign24.org/2025/schedule/) and watch the one that corresponds to the day of the month. Free content! No sign-in needed!

Each day until Christmas [Heydon is posting on Mastodon](https://front-end.social/@heydon/115643491947466740) a new shirt design in a series he calls “monochrome pride:” celebrating pride but without all the bright colors.

Damien Guard is returning with his [Masto-only 8×8 Font Advent Calendar](https://mastodon.social/@damieng/tagged/adventoffonts). The hashtag is #AdventOfFonts, so you can follow on your preferred Masto client / server.

I started tracking these in 2010. Since then some have come and gone. For the ones not returning, in many cases the content is still out there. Take a look and maybe you’ll find an older article that is useful today.
