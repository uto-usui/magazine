Okay, so here we are, about to kick off the build-along. Make sure you are [following me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/csswizardry) at around [**7pm UK time on the 4 November**](https://www.google.com/search?q=Time+in+the+UK&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a#pq=time+in+the+uk&hl=en&sugexp=kjrmc&cp=8&gs_id=b&xhr=t&q=Time+in+UK&tok=y6_ahb4u2yl-RL_lp8cxLw&pf=p&sclient=psy-ab&safe=off&client=firefox-a&hs=Q63&rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&source=hp&pbx=1&oq=Time+in++UK&aq=0&aqi=g2g-c1g1&aql=f&gs_sm=&gs_upl=&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&fp=282a81e04a27f8a1&biw=1024&bih=583) as I’m hoping to start the build-along around then. Thanks to [Levi Flair](http://www.leviflair.com/) for his PSD.

Thanks to everyone who sent a design in! I feel bad that I can’t do them all because the quality was really high. Sorry if I didn’t pick you, a lot more went into the decision than _just_ looks; I needed to consider time-frames, aesthetics, complexity and suitability to the build-along format.

## Follow along

Live code

You can watch the actual build take shape by [periodically refreshing this page](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2629908/build-along/index.html).

YouTube

I’m actually going to be recording my screen throughout the whole thing, code, Spotify, Twitter, you’ll see it all. I’ll be putting this online a few days after (I won’t be doing a live screen-cast).

GitHub

I’m going to commit build milestones to [a GitHub repo](https://github.com/csswizardry/build-along-1) periodically so you can see each major step of the build as it happens.

Twitter

[Follow me](https://twitter.com/csswizardry) and keep an eye on [the #buildAlong hashtag](https://twitter.com/search/%23buildAlong) (please also use this for anything you Tweet about the event).

Feel free to Tweet at me whilst I’m working. This should be fun!
