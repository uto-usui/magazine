For most organizations, Miro is the go-to platform for virtual visual collaboration. The platform helps teams brainstorm, plan, and align across every stage of product development, whether they’re together or apart. But Miro is just the starting point. To truly unlock its potential, teams need workflows, integrations, and processes that connect the boardroom sketches to working software in production.

That’s where Bitovi comes in.

## More than a whiteboard

We take Miro beyond the virtual whiteboard. Bitovi helps teams design, integrate, and scale collaboration workflows using Miro; faster and smarter. From custom integrations to workflow automation, we ensure that collaboration in Miro doesn’t stop at sticky notes and arrows but flows seamlessly into delivery.

-   **Accelerate adoption** with tailored Miro workflows and reusable templates
    
-   **Bridge discovery and delivery** by integrating Miro with Jira and Confluence
    
-   **Unlock efficiency** with custom Atlassian integrations
    
-   **Drive innovation** with product discovery workshops, whether you’re building apps, services, or even AI agents
    

Our consultants do it all, deliver features and partner with your team to solve problems, validate solutions, and maximize ROI. We collaborate shoulder-to-shoulder with you to refine ideas, validate quickly, and scale what works.

## Bitovi’s resident Miro expert: Meet Paul

![Paul Miro Cert](https://www.bitovi.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Paul%20Miro%20Cert%20(1).png?width=161&height=177&name=Paul%20Miro%20Cert%20(1).png)

Paul Herzog is Bitovi’s Director of Agile Project Management. His team works closely with clients to ensure that products are delivered efficiently, requirements are communicated clearly, and teams stay aligned on their goals.

As part of Bitovi’s new partnership with Miro, Paul recently earned his Miro Essentials certification, demonstrating his proficiency in creating and managing collaborative boards, organizing projects, and empowering teams to get the most out of Miro’s visual workspace.

Here’s what Paul loves about Miro:

> Too many meetings about product vision and requirement discovery turn into dictation sessions, where lots of people talk and one person tries to capture everything. **Miro's designed to draw people into wanting to collaborate** and contribute in a way that makes sense to everyone and ensures fewer important product needs get missed."
