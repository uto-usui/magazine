One-on-one meetings with your manager are one of the most valuable tools you have for career growth, problem-solving, and unlocking new opportunities. So if you’re only using them to provide status updates, you’re leaving a lot on the table.

I didn’t fully realize this potential until I mentioned in a one-on-one that I was interested in mentorship and growing my leadership skills. Not long after, I was asked to co-lead a project with an intern to build an internal tool that helped surface enterprise configuration details. This gave me the opportunity to take technical ownership on a project while mentoring someone in a real-world context—both of which pushed me outside my comfort zone in the best way. That experience made it clear: When used intentionally, one-on-ones can open doors you didn’t even know were there.

Many engineers treat one-on-ones as a low-stakes standup: reporting work, mentioning blockers, and getting general feedback. While that can be useful, it barely scratches the surface of what these meetings can accomplish. Instead, think of them as a system design review for your role—a time to debug challenges, optimize your workflow, and align on long-term career goals.

## [**Reframing your perception of what a one-on-one can accomplish**](#reframing-your-perception-of-what-a-one-on-one-can-accomplish)

A well-structured one-on-one meeting with your manager isn’t just a check-in, it’s an opportunity to shape your work environment and career trajectory. You wouldn’t build a system without evaluating its constraints, dependencies, and long-term maintainability. Why approach your career any differently?

Start by shifting your mindset: These meetings are not status updates. Your manager already sees your pull requests, sprint velocity, and planning docs. Instead, use this time to highlight _what matters_—what you’ve shipped, the value it’s delivered, and where the friction is.

You can also use this space to validate decisions and gather context. If you’re weighing different paths forward, don’t just ask for approval—frame the conversation in terms of trade-offs:

> “Here are the pros and cons of refactoring this service now versus later. How does this align with our broader business goals?”

Treat your manager like a decision-making API: Feed in the relevant signals, surface what’s unclear, and work together on an informed response.

## [**Use one-on-ones for career versioning (even before you’re “ready”)**](#use-one-on-ones-for-career-versioning-even-before-youre-ready)

One-on-one meetings are a great time to discuss your long-term career growth—even if you’re not actively seeking a promotion**.** Instead of waiting until promotion season, start having these conversations early to build clarity, direction, and momentum over time.

-   If you’re more than a year away from seeking a promotion, start talking to your manager about:
    -   _Where am I already meeting expectations?_
    -   _Where should I focus on strengthening my skills?_
-   If you’re approaching the next level or considering going up for promotion soon, try focusing the conversation on:
    -   _What kind of work would demonstrate readiness for the next level?_
    -   _Are there specific opportunities I can take on to grow my scope or visibility?_

By treating growth as an iterative process rather than an all-or-nothing milestone, you can continuously improve and course-correct based on early feedback.

A useful framework for structuring these discussions is the Three Circles of Impact:

1.  **Individual Contributions** – The direct value of your work.
2.  **Collaboration** – How you work with and support others across the team.
3.  **Enabling Others** – Mentorship, knowledge sharing, or improving systems and tooling for your peers.

If you’re not sure how to show impact across all three, your one-on-one is a great place to explore it. The key is surfacing your goals early so your manager can help guide you toward the kinds of work that will stretch your skills and broaden your influence.

The more you shape your contributions around these areas, the clearer your readiness for growth becomes—and the easier it is for your manager to advocate on your behalf.

## [**Your manager can’t debug what they don’t see**](#your-manager-cant-debug-what-they-dont-see)

Managers don’t have full visibility into your day-to-day experience, so one-on-ones are the right time to highlight persistent blockers and unclear expectations.

For instance, I once brought up a latency issue I was chasing down. The endpoint’s performance was slightly above our service level objective (SLO) target, and I had already spent a good chunk of time optimizing it. But in that conversation, my manager offered a different lens:

> “Are we optimizing for the right thing? We control the SLO. If the extra latency is due to how the system is designed (and if users aren’t impacted) maybe the right move is to revisit the threshold instead of squeezing more performance out of it.”

That single conversation saved me hours and helped me reframe the problem entirely. Sometimes, the fix isn’t in your code—it’s in how you’re measuring success.

## [**Make your one-on-ones work for you**](#make-your-one-on-ones-work-for-you)

Your one-on-ones will become far more effective—and lead to real growth—when you treat them as time to think strategically, not just check in. Reframing these meetings around your goals, your environment, and your long-term development puts you in a much stronger position to advocate for yourself and your work.

Start thinking about your career progression earlier than feels natural. Come prepared. Bring in what’s going well, what’s stuck, and where you want to grow. And remember: your manager can’t fix what they don’t know about, and they can’t support your goals if you never share them.

If this shift feels unfamiliar, you’re not alone. _The Engineer’s Survival Guide_ helped me reframe my thinking around one-on-ones.

Here are a few ideas that stuck with me:

-   Your manager isn’t a mind reader.
-   You can’t expect guidance if you don’t come with a direction.
-   Your growth is a shared effort, but it starts with you.

The earlier you see one-on-ones as a tool for impact and growth, the more value you’ll get from them.
