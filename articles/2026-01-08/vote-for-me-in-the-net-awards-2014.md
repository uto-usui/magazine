[Personal](https://lea.verou.me/blog/tags/personal "40 posts with this tag")

[![](http://future-publishing.msgfocus.com/files/amf_future_publishing/project_270/net-awards-2014-nominee-ribbon.png)](https://thenetawards.com/vote/contribution/lea-verou/)I was excited and surprised to find out I’ve been in the 10 finalists for two (2!) categories in the net awards this year:

-   [Outstanding contribution](https://thenetawards.com/vote/contribution/lea-verou/)
-   [Conference Talk of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/talk/lea-verou-the-humble-border-rad/) (for The humble border-radius)

You can vote for me by clicking the above links and have my eternal gratitude :-)

Furthermore, the CERN line mode browser project, of which [I was a part of](http://line-mode.cern.ch/interviews/), has been [nominated in “Best Collaborative Project”](https://thenetawards.com/vote/collaboration/line-mode-browser-2013/)!

I’ve given “The humble border-radius” more than once, so you can pick one to watch below (in the net awards page they’ve linked to the FOWD London one):

-   [CSSDay](http://vimeo.com/70171266)
-   [CSSConf](http://cssconf.com/talk-verou.html)
-   [FOWD London](http://www.futureinsights.com/home/lea-verou-keynote-the-humble-border-radius.html)
-   [Front-Trends](http://vimeo.com/67567648)
-   [Abridged version (only 15 minutes!) from this year’s O’Reilly Fluent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSaMl2OKjfQ)

I would recommend the CSSDay one, as it changes every time and that one is newer.

Thanks again to anyone who nominated me and everyone who votes for me. You’re all wonderful. <3
