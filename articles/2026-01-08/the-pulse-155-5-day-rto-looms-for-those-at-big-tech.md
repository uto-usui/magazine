_The Pulse is a series covering events, insights, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? Hit reply and share it with me._

Today, we cover:

1.  **Could a 5-day RTO be around the corner in Big Tech?** From next February, workers at Instagram must be in the office, five days a week. This makes Meta the second tech giant after Amazon to mandate a 5-day RTO. Will more big companies do the same?
    
2.  **Are senior engineers better with AI than juniors are?** Data from more than 40,000 users of Cursor suggests that experienced devs get better results from AI agents. It suggests the tool amplifies coding skills – not replace them.
    
3.  **Industry Pulse.** OpenAI dumps Mixpanel after security breach, Stripe buys usage metering startup, OpenAI’s “Code Red,” a high-risk security issue at a $3B legal startup, and more.
    
4.  **Anthropic and Claude Code on a roll.** Claude Code just surpassed $1B in annual run rate revenue after 6 months, Anthropic buys JavaScript runtime Bun, and might plan to go public as soon as next year.
