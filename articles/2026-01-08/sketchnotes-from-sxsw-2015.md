Designing for Trust with [Michael Boeke](https://twitter.com/mvboeke). Basically: be a human being, not a robot.

[Jennifer's](https://twitter.com/JenniferDewalt) talk was really awesome, engaging, and inspiring. Left me with a lot of questions (as you can see).

[Sasha's](https://twitter.com/SashRocks) talk was one of the best technical talks I had seen all day. Slides are posted online [here.](http://www.slideshare.net/spasulka/this-is-your-brain-on-visual-data-sxsw-2015)

This was also a brilliant talk. [Pamela](https://twitter.com/paminthelab) is a fantastic speaker (and she brought us mood rings!).
