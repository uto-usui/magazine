[Future Sync](https://futuresync.co.uk/) conference recently published the videos from their 2019 conference, including the one from my talk, **Building Complex Layouts with CSS Grid**. If you’re new to CSS Grid, or haven’t had the chance to play around with it too much yet, this could be a good introduction. I start of with some basic usage and progressively get onto more complex examples, explaining different placement methods, and using the `minmax()` function to craft flexible layouts.
