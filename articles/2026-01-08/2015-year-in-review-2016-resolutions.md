Published on December 28, 2015

[Last year](http://una.im/2015-resolutions) I started a (now annual) tradition of reviewing my personal goals, and setting new ones. Looking back, **I can’t believe how much has happened this year.** It’s definitely been a roller coaster, and I’ve definitely grown a ton as a person. Thank you all for joining me on this journey!

## 2015 Retrospective

Here are a few projects I’ve launched over the past year (all source code available on GitHub, where I made **2,396 commits** this year):

-   [Sass Director](http://sassdirector.com/): A file generator for Sass partials that uses a single “director script” (aka your `main.scss`)
-   [Gulp Starter Environment](https://github.com/una/gulp-starter-env): Created for the designers I worked with to learn gulp and get familiar with using Github.
-   [Happy Moments](http://happy-moments.herokuapp.com/): A node app that pulls in a single happy moment memory from each day I’ve had this year.
-   [Travels](http://travels.surge.sh/): A web experiment site that uses filters and blend modes, featuring my travel poetry as content.
-   [CSSgram](http://una.github.io/cssgram): A tiny CSS library recreating Instragram filters using just CSS features.
-   [Toolsday](http://toolsday.io/): A 20-ish-minute podcast about the latest in tech tools, tips, and tricks (hosted along with my coworker, [Chris](https://twitter.com/chrisdhanaraj))
-   [arttheweb.com](http://arttheweb.com/): A collection of my articles, talks, and web experiments based around designing in the browser.

That was all outside of work. At IBM, I worked on two large-scale pattern libraries (one for Watson and one for Bluemix), built prototypes for product iterations, and helped build a Front-End Development community and curriculum for trainings.

### Knowledge Sharing

Last year, I said I wanted to “participate in conferences and community” as one of my goals. With that dream in mind, I went about applying to speak at conferences, hoping to get invited to one. Here’s what actually happened:

![dog gif](https://una.im/posts/2015-review/dog.gif)

I gave **17 talks/workshops** on Sass, UI interaction, performance optimizations, keyboard ninjary, open source design, goal setting, and CSS filters and blend modes. I wrote **30 blog posts** on topics ranging from experimental (like [Generative Pixel Art](http://una.im/sass-pixel-art/) via Sass matrices and blend-mode hacks to create [Faux 3d Effects](http://una.im/3d-effect), to quite practical ([5 Uses for Sass Maps](http://www.sitepoint.com/5-great-uses-sass-maps/) and a class-based [CSS architecture](http://una.im/classy-css/) system). I also _recorded audio for every post I wrote on my blog_ and the audiobook version of the [SVG Pocket Guide](http://svgpocketguide.com/book/). And finally, I started a **podcast** about developer tools called [Toolsday](http://toolsday.io/)!

> If you'd like to support my code calligraphy or just send a simple thank you, I made an [Amazon wishlist](http://amzn.com/w/2BOPP6HPWDL9S) of pens, paper, and audiobooks :)

I also started doing **code calligraphy** as a way to visualize some mnemonic devices and solidify my skills. People on Twitter seemed to really resonate with them, so I want to make more. A lot of people mentioned that they wanted prints, a book, or posters. I’ve got some ideas, but we’ll see how it pans out with time.

### Other Things

I traveled _a lot_ this year. According to my TripIt data, I traveled a total of **139,872 miles** to **29 cities** in **8 countries**. Where? Australia, England, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and France (and many trips around the US too). While short conference trips can be taxing, I do really love to travel. My [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/unakravets/) is now full of photos from my adventures _and_ I got to meet so many awesome people (the best part of conferences)!

I started to read a lot, too (by read, I really mean _listen_ to audiobooks). I finished **51 books** [this year](https://github.com/una/personal-goals/blob/master/ideas-and-misc/book-checklist.md). My favorites were:

-   _Ready Player One_ by Ernest Cline
-   _All the Light We Cannot See_ by Anthony Doerr
-   _The Martian_ by Andy Weir
-   _Outliers_ by Malcolm Gladwell
-   _Ghost in the Wires_ by Kevin Mitnick
-   _Ender’s Game_ by Orson Scott Card

### Recognition

Apparently people took notice of my work, but didn’t know where to categorize my contributions. I was shortlisted for [Young Designer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/young-designer/) while also getting on a list of [2015’s Top JS Devs to Follow](http://blog.bithound.io/2015-top-js-devs/) and [Female Tech Influencers](http://skillcrush.com/2015/11/04/50-female-tech-influencers-to-follow-on-twitter/) 💪. One day there will be a place for people like us.

### Personal Goals Outline

So how am I doing on those overall goals I laid out last year?

1.  Build quickly, ship things, and learn. _(yep!)_
2.  Contribute to Open Source _(hell yeah!)_
3.  Share knowledge as often as possible _(definitely!)_
4.  Appreciate the creative & talented people in my life _(I try)_
5.  Use Vim + the keyboard more often _(yes!)_
6.  Up my JS Game _(I’m definitely better but should learn way more)_
7.  Performance-first advocacy _(yep!)_
8.  Foster designer participation in OS projects _(around me, yes — outside, maybe?)_
9.  Participate in conferences & community _(LOL. yes)_
10.  Use web components _(nope)_
11.  Be kinder _( ¯\\\_ (ツ) \_/¯ )_

## 2016: Small Dreams are Boring

![](https://una.im/posts/2015-review/mantra.jpg)

That's my mantra for the year. To dream big and put in the effort to make things happen.

### Professional Goals

There are so many things I want to learn and get better at! First and foremost, **JavaScript.** I feel like I have a general grasp on most web-development concerns (accessibility, performance, progressive enhancement), and I’m pretty darn good at styling (Sass & CSS). So for me, the next step is to really focus on improving my JavaScript skills from just being functional to having a really good base understanding of how to build and work within a web app. .

> I'm going to share as I learn, so get ready to join the JavaScript train, my friends.

If you follow me for my CSS content, don’t worry — I’m not going to stop writing about other front-end topics, I just also want to understand flux architecture and all the magics of Webpack. I want to understand good API design and improve my knowledge of algorithms and data structures. I think I just need to start building some apps out for this (and I have a few ideas in mind already!)

I also really want to **write a book** on an entirely different topic — which is about working with images in the browser. It will cover everything from choosing a media format to performance to getting fancy with filters and blend modes. I’m currently in the process of _looking for a publisher_ — so if you know any interested, feel free to forward them my email address (see footer). _(also, feel free to send me email to say hello, because why not?)_

### Personal Goals

![](https://una.im/posts/2015-review/silks.jpg)

Look, Mom! I'm upside-down!

First and foremost, after years of hackathons and conferences, I’ve come to realize that my wardrobe has now come to resemble that of a 20-year-old startup bro. Worse still is that I got comfortable wearing these tshirts and jeans every day to work everywhere. I want to **dress better**. And actually make time to go shopping :) that might help. Pinterest too.

I also want to get fit again (yes, I failed at this in 2015 — but I blame all of the travel). I started taking classes like aerial silks, which were awesome, and I want to continue those while also training for a **half-marathon**. I know it’s going to suck at first, but hopefully I’ll learn to love running again. I need to prioritize my health.

My last personal goal from 2015 was to be better at **keeping in touch** with people I think I failed on that too. So I’m going to try to better in the future.

### 2016 Goals Overview

I’m cutting this down to fewer and more concise goals than last years. Here they are:

1.  **JavaScript.** It’s so powerful, and I want to get much better at it so I can be a powerful wizard, too!
2.  **Write a Book** I have a book idea in mind and I really want to make it a reality.
3.  **Bridge the Designer/Developer Gap** Continue sharing knowledge on front-end topics relevant to both designers and devs.
4.  **Build All The Things** Build things quickly, ship, learn, and then build them better. Open source it all, too.
5.  **Prioritize my Health** Run that half marathon — fitness is mandatory, not optional.

I’ll leave you with this lovely holiday song about the state of developer life from your [Toolsday](http://toolsday.io/) hosts (Chris Dhanaraj and me) 😃
