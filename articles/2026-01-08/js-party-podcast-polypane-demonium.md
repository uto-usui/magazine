## JS Party podcast: Polypane-demonium

[Web](https://kilianvalkhof.com/category/web/), 21 June 2024, < 1

I was invited to the JS Party podcast to talk about all things Polypane, from the business side of things to nitty-gritty features that I’ve been working on. I had a lot of fun and I think Nick and Jerod did as well.

> Polypane purveyor Kilian Valkhof joins Nick & Jerod to tell us all about his efforts building a web browser just for web development. We cover it all: from the business concerns, to the technical details, to his excellent choice not to use TypeScript! We even sneak in a feature request that already made its way into this excellent dev tool for ambitious web developers.
