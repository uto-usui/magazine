### There is no textbook for this kind of design

We're witnessing the birth of a new kind of designer: The AI Designer.

Designers who work in evals, prompts, and tool calls.

Designers who have as much of a taste for models as they do for fonts.

Designers who think in mental models, agents, and intelligence.

There's no textbook for this kind of design (and things change so fast, it wouldn't make sense to write one).

Instead, we need a field guide. A living record of our learnings, tips, tricks, fears, dreams, curiosities, and hot takes.
