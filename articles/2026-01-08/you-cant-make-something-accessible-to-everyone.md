This post’s title is unpleasant, but it’s important to acknowledge the reality of the human condition and limitations in technologies. Even purpose-built assistive tech.

Broadly, when someone says something is “accessible” that’s a hopeful statement that is based on some best efforts. Of course, there are bad actors who [assert something is accessible](https://adrianroselli.com/2022/11/your-accessibility-claims-are-wrong-unless.html) because they just [want the clicks](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web.dev/issues/8959) or [don’t invest much effort](https://adrianroselli.com/2025/05/my-request-to-google-on-accessibility.html). Others [assert their pet features](https://alice.boxhall.au/articles/a-threat-model-for-accessibility-on-the-web/) are to “make something accessible” but are unable to explain how. Some even [promise the technology to do it](https://adrianroselli.com/tag/overlay) — [even formerly legitimate practitioners](https://adrianroselli.com/2025/03/be-wary-of-accessibility-guarantees-from-anyone.html).

There are many people who think making a web site that passes WCAG 2.2 at Level AA makes it accessible. I’ve [documented many cases](https://adrianroselli.com/?s=%22adversarial+conformance%22) where that’s not true, [as have others](https://www.craigabbott.co.uk/blog/2025/5-reasons-why-wcag-aa-compliance-does-not-mean-your-website-is-accessible/), some [for years now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADIgU53Y2Rg).

If you think passing WCAG at Level AAA will be _more_ accessible, then I know plenty of people who’d like to have a conversation with [SC 1.4.6: Contrast (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html) for encoding eye pain.

I keep trying to stress (with authors, clients, spec writers, GitHub randos, LLM aficionados, …) that accessibility is about people. It is not a strictly technical problem to be solved with code.

Because people have varying needs across disparate contexts from assorted expectations with unequal skill levels using almost random technologies, never mind current moods and real-life distractions, to suggest one thing will be accessible for _everyone_ in _all_ those circumstances is pure hubris. Or lack of empathy. Maybe a mix.

I’m not suggesting that claiming something is “accessible” is an overtly bad act. I am saying, however, that maybe you should explain _what_ accessibility features it has, and let that guide people. It’s more honest to them and you.

_This_ is why we keep working at accessibility. To shrink those cases. To move halfway to the wall, over and over, until we cannot slide a sheet of paper between our nose and the cold vinyl siding of reality. That’s why we keep up the work. That’s why we continue to try. To make things better for yet more people, even if we can’t cover everyone.

Stop beating yourself up and be wary of those who maybe aren’t.
